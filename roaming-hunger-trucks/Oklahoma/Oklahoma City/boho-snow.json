  "description": "Boho Snow is a mobile shaved ice stand created in the up and coming city of Oklahoma. Run by bohemian individuals who strive on creativity and positivity. We focus on fun times, good vibes,   spreading the love,  while also creating our yummmmmy one-of-a-kind snow cones! From plain jane flavors, to crazy toppings such as: different types of cream, fresh fruit, candy, coffee, ice cream, vegetables (trust us, it\u2019s good), organic flavors and many more. We have it all and everything in between. We also love to be creative, creating specialty names for flavors to match with your specific event. Traveling anywhere in the metro + out of state, this snow cone stand is ready for any event!",
