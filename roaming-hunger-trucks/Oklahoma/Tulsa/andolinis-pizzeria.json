  "description": "This authentic pizza by the slice truck is offering Tulsa residents a taste of traditional New England pizza. From their Roasted Garlic, to their Demarco of Brooklyn (topped with D.O.P San Marzano tomatoes, home-made mozzarella, fresh picked basil and pecorino romano) every slice is packed with flavor. Not in the mood for pizza? They've got sandwich and salad lovers covered as well. ",
