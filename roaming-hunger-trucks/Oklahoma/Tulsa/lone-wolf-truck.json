  "description": "French/Vietnamese fusion food truck in the heart of Tulsa, Ok. Serving Banh Mi and Beignets to the masses. Savory, sweet, sour, and spicy. A perfect balance. Harmony served from a truck. The best place in Tulsa to get a great Banh Mi. The (only?) place to get caramelized Kimchi fries, and the best Beignets outside of Nola!",
