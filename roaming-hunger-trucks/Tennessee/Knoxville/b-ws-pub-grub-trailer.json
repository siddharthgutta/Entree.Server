Yes, we do weenies - weenies with gourmet toppings like truck-made tzaziki sauce on our Big Fat Greek Weenie and Hillbilly Chili for our Single Wide Weenie; but we also do Specialty Sandwiches like Croque Monsieur - a high class French grilled sandwich, with ham and provolone cheese & house-made garlic aioli; Pita Pizza Margherita - the original pizza, made personal with house-made tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, seasonal tomatoes and a chiffenade  of fresh basil, and broiled until it's oozey, goozey and delicious; PLUS hot dishes like New Orleans StyleRed Beans and Rice (usually on a Monday - that's laundry day in Louisiana), with onion, peppers, celery, andouille sausage and a bunch of spices that I can't tell you....  There's a Mini Muffaletta - you just have to try those to truly experience it !!  And don'tforget BREEZY'S SPICY BALLS !!  The perfect side dish for any sandwich - new potatoes cooked with Creole spices that will smoke your hair !!  Whoooo Boy !!!",
