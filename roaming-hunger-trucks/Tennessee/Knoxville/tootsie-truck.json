We believe that 'simplicity\" is the secret to a good meal. Everything we make is all-natural and from scratch - pasta, bread, mayo, everything. Nothing we serve ever comes from a can or a frozen box. We frequently feature local produce, meats, and cheeses and we pride ourselves on our environmental focus. Come see us on the road, or contact us today to begin planning your next special event.tootsie loves the earthWe take great care to keep the future of our environment in mind with everything we do.
