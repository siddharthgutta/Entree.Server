We are the easiest fundraiser you will ever do, just show us where to park and who to make the check out to...we will do the rest. Don't need to fundraise? We do events of all kinds! Have us out to bring a healthier option to your event. We consist of 2 trucks and a mini vehicle that can go indoors or through small entrances.",
