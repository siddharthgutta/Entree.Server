  "description": "Thank the food Gods for answering our prayers - there is finally a food truck dedicated to one of the most delicious culinary inventions: The smoked chicken wing. Smokin Thighs is gracing the streets of Nashville with your choice of wings, thighs, and or legs as well as a variety of different rubs ranging from mild to hottest. They also give you the option to add a number of toppings for 50 cents each; add a side of broccoli or mac and cheese and you're in food heaven. ",
