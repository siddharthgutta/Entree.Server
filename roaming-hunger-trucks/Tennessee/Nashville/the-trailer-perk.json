  "description": "Start your day right with a visit to the Trailer Perk, Nashville's very own mobile Coffee shop! Their menu includes a number of coffee drinks such as lattes, mochas, cappuccinos, and blended frappes. If you're not a big coffee drinker, they also offer a variety of non-coffee drinks like tea, soda, apple cider and hot chocolate. If you'd like a bite to eat with your coffee, Trailer Perk has got you covered. Choose from any of their delicious breakfast sandwiches, or opt for some hearty oatmeal or a yummy bakery item. ",
