This starts with ice BLOCKS made with filtered water. If you don't see a block, it's not really shaved ice! We then hand craft our own flavors using 100% cane sugar. Nor corn syrup here! Come give us a try! Contact us about private events or if you'd like us at your location. No event is too big or too small!",
