  "description": "Tigermeat Hot Dog is not your standard New York stand. Located in Nashville, Tigermeat strives to have the simplest set up, best product and best service! . Being from Chicago, it was a no brainer for the Tigermeat family to have their featured product be the \"Chicago Dog.\" They exclusively use Vienna Beef, who uses 100% all beef, carefully selected for the highest quality meat. Their hot dogs are served in a steamed poppy seed bun topped with fresh cut condiments prepared the same day.",
