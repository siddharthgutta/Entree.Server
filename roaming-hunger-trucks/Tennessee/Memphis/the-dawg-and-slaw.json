  "description": "The Dog and Slaw is shaking up the Memphis food cart scene by offering taste buds a deliciously unique way of enjoying hot dogs!Lovingly feathered before they hit the grill, every dog comes topped with French\u2019s mustard and our vinegar-based slaw, which remains a guarded family recipe no matter how many times you ask for it. Oh, the flavor these quarter-pound dogs take on after prepared will leave you satisfied in a way you never knew possible. As one customer put it, \u201cAfter every bite, you gotta have another!\u201d There\u2019s much more to the product than the unlikely combination of hot dogs with slaw and mustard served on special hoagie-style buns...Only Wellshire Farms all natural beef dogs\u2014a product free of preservatives, nitrates, nitrites and artificial ingredients\u2014are served from this cart. And another thing: no steroids or growth-promoting hormones can be found in these dogs! ",
