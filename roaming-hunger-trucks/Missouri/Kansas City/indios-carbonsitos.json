  "description": "Never trust a skinny mans food!! if he doesn't eat his food, why should you? :) El sazon del gordito es mas sabrosito!!Our food is a little different in the sense that we are trying to create recipes that are true to the original versions of Mexican street food but giving them a twist.  The same goes for the BBQ style we use.  Every ingredient we use is of the highest quality and we pride ourselves in that.  We understand we won't make as much profit due to this but we believe the quality of a product comes through and you can taste it.  ",
