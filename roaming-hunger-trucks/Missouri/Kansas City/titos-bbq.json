  "description": "Kansas City is quite famous for their robust Barbeque scene, and thanks to the oh-so-chromatic Tito\u2019s BBQ truck, there are now some fresh Filipino flavors in the mix. Tito Ardie (\u201cTito\u201d is Tagalog for \u201cuncle\u201d, a title used to express respect for authority, elders, etc...) is taking his extensive experience in the hospitality industry, as well as his passion for Filipino cuisine to bring you Tito\u2019s BBQ. Modeled after a Jeepney (a common and colorful mode of transportation in the Philippines), this festive truck is where you\u2019ll find a succulent selection of meat skewers that are marinated and grilled to perfection. Tito is also serving up other authentic fare, like lumpia (tasty filipino eggrolls), chicken empanadas, siopao (pork stuffed steamed buns), and so much more. If you\u2019re looking for delightful fun and deliciousness at your next event, just know that Tito\u2019s cuisine is perfect for every type of party!",
