  "description": "Little Italy is an Italian food truck using old family recipes.  With strongItalian roots all of the sauces are handmade and only made with the finestproducts.  We use local farmers along with local Italian suppliers for allof our meats, cheeses and breads.Keeping with the Kansas City Italian traditions our Italian steaks areflattened then breaded with a blend of spices and cheeses. The meatballrecipe goes way back with Ma perfecting the recipe so that it is one of thebest in KC.  The Chicken Spedini isn't your typical KC recipe as we marinateit over night in bread, wine, olive oil and spices and serve it on a skewer.Italian sausage you say? This is not served on a bun but reconstructed to beeaten with a fork and knife, only the hungry can finish it.  Who could livewithout our Italian Cone Fry's?  A must have when you come to our truck.Come find us!!",
