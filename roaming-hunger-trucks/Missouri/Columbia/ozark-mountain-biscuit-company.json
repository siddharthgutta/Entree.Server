  "description": "Our story starts in northeast Arkansas where the Mississippi Delta mud gives way to the flinty foothills of the Ozarks. In that crook of river country five generations of our family sharecropped, farmed, canned, moonshined, and refined the fixin' of delicious food all the while.At the Ozark Mountain Biscuit Company we honor that history with fresh, quality, seasonal ingredients. Heck, we try to grow it ourselves when we can and find other local partners to help us out. We hope you\u2019ll find our updated take on our family food to your liking. Sure, there are some things on our food truck that our great-grandma Jettie wouldn\u2019t begin to recognize, but we know she would find them delicious!",
