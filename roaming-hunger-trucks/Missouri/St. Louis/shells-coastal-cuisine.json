  "description": "Shell\u2019s Coastal Cuisine food truck was thought up by several family members, who are also co-owners of the truck. Shell\u2019s Coastal Cuisine reflects how we feel about family, fun, and Floribbean flavors!Our truck is run on a daily basis by Chef/Owner, Shelley McMahan, a graduate from Le Cordon Bleu Culinary College located in St. Louis, Missouri. The other regulars on board are also Chef Graduates from Le Cordon Bleu. We have traveled to many locations where the food we serve comes from (except Cuba), and we personally learned from different Chef\u2019s in all of these locations. We want to share these flavors because they are so good! Stop by and grab something to eat!",
