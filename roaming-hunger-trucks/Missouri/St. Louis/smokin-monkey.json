  "description": "Smokin\u2019 Monkey might be the big scoop here. Lucas Park Grille Executive Chef Kyle Patterson and wife Kimberly Patterson (below) have decided to indulge a yen for Carribean and smoked foods, and offer the city yet another type of cuisine heretofore unserved from a vehicle. In their first week of service, the Pattersons plated up jerk chicken, pulled pork sandwiches with pineapple-rum bbq sauce, and \u201cPBLT\u201d (porkbelly-lettuce-tomato) sandwiches, along with sides and drinks.The stars of the show, though, are the duck-confit tacos  smoked right on the back of the truck. The house-made (and locally sourced) plum/chipotle jam, slaw, sprinkle of cilantro and juicy duck on a flour tortilla make it clear \u2013 this is a food truck in the mold of Guerrilla Street Food, helmed by an accomplished restaurant chef bringing excellent fare to the lucky lunching laborers of Downtown.",
