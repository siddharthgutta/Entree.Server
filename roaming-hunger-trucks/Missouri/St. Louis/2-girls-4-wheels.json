The beauty of having a mobile food truck is that we can come to you!  Whether it is a game, concert, or festival, rain or shine, count on us to be there to serve our tasty innovations.  We want locals and visitors to feel invited when they see us and we feel our truck will contribute to the energy this great city already has to offer. 2girls4wheels is our mobile creation, and serving gateway grub while showing St. Louis love is what we stand for!\"See you soon!",
