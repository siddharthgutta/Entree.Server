From the stone ground grains from their own local mill to the dairy, meats and produce used on the pizzas to the wood burning oven they are cooked in you can taste the quality and love that is put into these pies. Once you taste the pizza at MozzaPi, you won't want to go back to one of those chain restaurants again.",
