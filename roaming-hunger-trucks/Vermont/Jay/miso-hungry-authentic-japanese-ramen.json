  "description": "When Jordan & Momo met in Japan, it became crystal clear that they were meant to do great things together. Along with snowboarding, traveling the world, and workin\u2019 hard, they also run Miso Hungry, Vermont\u2019s most favorite Ramen spot. Their menu features local favorites, like Roasted Sesame Ramen Salad (with Momo\u2019s secret roasted sesame dressing, baby arugula, crisp mixed peppers, sun burst cherry tomatoes, chilled red onions, and a marinated soft-boiled egg), Spicy Ramen, Gyoza, and more- all made with locally sourced and authentic ingredients, all delicious. So, if \u201cMiso Hungry\u201d, then you so lucky, because this special food truck is serving up satisfying scrumptiousness. ",
