  "description": "Farm-to-truck is certainly the forte of these chefs as they forage through local Vermont farms to find the freshest ingredients and from there, spontaneously create a beautifully flavorful menu that changes with the seasons.  No matter what selection of fare you\u2019re feasting on - whether it\u2019s Fried Avocado Tacos, a B.L.T., or a fresh and light Kale & Arugula Salad - you\u2019ll find that every dish served from this truck is incredibly fantastic. Just ask any of your foodie friends; every Vermonter who\u2019s eaten at this truck appears to be Farmers & Foragers' biggest fan. ",
