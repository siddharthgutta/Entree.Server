  "description": "Foodies of Keene, New Hampshire sure find this family-run truck to be quite keen, with its delicious selection of homemade vegetarian cuisine. Their selection of vegetarian/vegan Salads, Sandwiches, Burgers, and Quesadillas are all made with fresh local ingredients, and with every meal you order here, you\u2019ll know that you\u2019re helping a small farm to grow. We also hear that their incredible Chai beverages (hot or iced) are an absolute must-try. So just ask any local, and they will confess that the fare from Farm Concessions is simply the best.",
