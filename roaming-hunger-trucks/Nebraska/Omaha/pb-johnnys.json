  "description": "We all love a good ole PB&J; the simple yet perfect flavor combination that unites us all as we\u2019re  transported right back to our childhoods with every bite. John Jelinek is certainly familiar with this nostalgic feeling. In fact, it inspired him to fulfill quite a creative culinary mission: provide the streets of Omaha with this classic treat, along with similar sandwiches with a bit of a gourmet twist. You\u2019ll only find the highest quality local ingredients in this sensational selection of signature sandwiches such as the PB Chipotle Burger (peanut butter, pepper jack cheese, chipotle slaw), The Tin Can (almond butter, fig jam, goat cheese, honey, bacon), and The Modified Elvis (peanut butter, nutella, fluff, banana), just to name a few. Or you can customize your own sandwich and blow your own mind with your PB creation. Come eat at PB Johnny\u2019s for a taste of your past and you\u2019ll create a few delicious new memories that you\u2019ll surely savor in the future. ",
