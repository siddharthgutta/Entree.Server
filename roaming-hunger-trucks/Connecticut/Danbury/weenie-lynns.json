  "description": "The epitome of a summer food, the hot dog sometimes gets overlooked. From the classic white bun with mustard to gourmet dogs with an assortment of toppings, the hot dog is always a good choice. Don't miss the fresh-cut French fries... plain, or cheesy, or chili-cheese, or bbq pulled pork/cole slaw topped!   We also do kielbasa, bratwurst, gourmet grilled cheeses (bbq pulled pork grilled cheese our specialty for starters) and fresh-made mini donuts!   We are so much more than a hot dog trailer!",
