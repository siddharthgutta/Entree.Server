  "description": "Arancinis, or Italian rice balls, were invented in Sicily to use up leftover risotto by rolling them into balls, breading and frying them in golden oil. The arancini cart is the one of the earliest incarnations of the food truck and Have a Ball NYC is bringing the tradition to Connecticut. A daily selection of rice balls with meat, vegetarian and gluten free options is waiting for you!",
