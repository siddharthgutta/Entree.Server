  "description": "Family owned and operated since the beginning, the restaurant is now part of the history and culture of the Village. Its tradition extends to serving the likes of many famous musicians, actors, and other celebrities. There is an energy and flare to the place that cannot be captured in words. Whether it\u2019s the tiny \u201chole in the wall\u201d charm, the high paced/ high volume energy, or the dynamic clientele, going to Mamoun\u2019s for a falafel can transform a meal into a unique dining experience. Through the years, we\u2019ve been featured on the food network, travel guide channel, and many newspapers, magazines and books.What sets us apart from other Falafel restaurants is our rich tradition and history as well as our commitment to excellence. Our philosophy is simple: authentic Middle Eastern Cuisine served in a traditional environment. Everything we serve is made from scratch using only the freshest natural ingredients, the finest imported spices, and our signature recipes.",
