  "description": "Taco Pacifico has had its ups and downs. It was featured in several news articles after it opened, but after the first close for winter season, misfortune beset the truck on all sides. Greg Sharon, however, battled through, and we couldn't be more glad that he did, because these tacos, burritos, tostadas, quesadillas, and more are some of the most delicious Mexican fare you'll find on the East Coast! So stop by when you see Taco Pacifico at a curbside near you, or, better yet, bring them out to your next fiesta! It'll be a party to remember.",
