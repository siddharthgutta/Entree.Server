  "description": "Beginning in early June, Marco Pollo - Global Cluck Truck, will be hitting the streets to join the local food truck scene. The concept is a combined effort of local high school teacher and veteran culinary instructor, Stephen Bloch, and two of his students, Marshall Lerner and Zach Nelsen.The inspiration for Marco Pollo comes from years of international travel and adventurous eating. Marco Pollo will offer a variety of international chicken dishes (either lightly breaded based on a secret family recipe or grilled), served with a rotation of authentic from \"scratch\" sauces from Thailand, China, India, Creole Country, Montreal, Japan, Mexico/Texas and even Buffalo, N.Y.",
