  "description": "City: MilwaukeeStreetza is voted 10 best Food trucks in the US by GQ Magazine. This popular truck makes pizzas by hand with fresh and unique ingredients.  Bringing you delicious pizza by the slice.  The perfect thickness.  Right in-between New York Style and Chicago Style is Streetza Style.  A perfect crust, flakey on the inside, crisp on the outside.  Not too thin, not too thick.  Just like your Italian grandmother would make if you locked her in the back of a truck. Available with your favorite fresh toppings \u2013 by the slice.  And for the record, size does matter.  Which is why our slices are huge.  1/8 of an almost 18\u2033 pizza, means one will be more than enough to curb your late-night hunger.",
