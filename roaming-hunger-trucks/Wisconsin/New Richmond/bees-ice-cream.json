  "description": "After having little luck landing a summer job to start saving up for college, the ever-entrepreneurial Breanna Simon, at 17 years old, employed herself as the Founder/Owner/Operator of Bee\u2019s Ice Cream. Three extremely successful years later and now every adult & child alike is always delighted to see (or hear!) Bee\u2019s Ice Cream truck make its way down their street because it means that it\u2019s time to indulge in a tasty frozen treat. With their famously sweet service, vast selection of novelty favorites, and hoppin' music box, Bee\u2019s Ice Cream is the perfect truck for every kind of occasion!",
