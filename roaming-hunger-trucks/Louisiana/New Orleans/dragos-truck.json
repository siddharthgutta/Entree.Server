  "description": "People often ask us about the secret to our success. It\u2019s no secret. You see it at the restaurant every day. We all love what we do.It\u2019s been that way since Drago and Klara Cvitanovich opened our restaurant in 1969. They set out to offer delicious seafood and a good time to guests for a reasonable price. At that time, they couldn\u2019t even imagine how many guests that would become.Today it\u2019s still a family atmosphere. Klara is still at the front to greet our guests. Tommy Cvitanovich, Drago and Klara\u2019s son, is there to see that things run smoothly. And though 88-year-old Drago doesn\u2019t select the oysters himself anymore, you can still see him at the restaurant when he\u2019s not on duty as Grandpa.Our family has grown a lot since the early days\u2014and our work family too. It would be impossible to do what we do without our very hard-working and loyal staff. Drago\u2019s now has more than 300 employees who help us carry our legacy forward. And we all have a great time doing it!Drago\u2019s knows how to throw a good party. Our specially outfitted Charbroiling Engine Co. fire truck is the talk of the town, and with good reason! Our customized truck has won multiple tailgating contests, including a spot at the tailgating championship finals at the Super Bowl in Dallas!Our fire truck is fitted with special chargrills, beer taps, flat screen televisions on Direct TV\u2014even a Jagermeister dispenser! Look for it at fairs, festivals, or Saints games at the Super Bowl\u2014where it won a 2010 tailgating competition. Come see it for yourself or rent it for your special event!",
