  "description": "The grilled cheese is one of the most simple meals  yet somehow manages to be one of the tastiest. Frencheeze prides itself on reinventing this amazing classic with bold flavors like gouda, goat cheese, and blue cheese. If that's not cheesy enough for ya, try their deep fried mac n' cheese balls. Gluten free bread is also available for customers. ",
