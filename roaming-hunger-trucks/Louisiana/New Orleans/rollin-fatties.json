  "description": "While Rollin' Fatties has banned red meat from its menu, that doesn't mean that it has no flavor. With a core ingredient set of jerk seasoned tofu, caramelized tilapia, chipotle cream, and Monterey Jack cheese, you're sure to get a burrito, rice bowl, taco, or nacho dish that you won't forget in a hurry. Find this truck on the streets of New Orleans and get yourself a tasty and healthy meal!",
