  "description": "RE BBQ began in 2009 on a tiny backyard smoker, serv- ing pulled pork at a summer festival. As word got out, more requests for RE BBQ started coming in, so my father and I designed and built THE BEAST at his machine shop. Since then, RE BBQ has fed weddings, bike races, VA hospitals and other events around Michigan. In 2014 I traded in my 20 year It career for a much more enjoyable life of cooking and serving delicious food that makes people happy.Like THE BEAST, RE BBQ\u2019s menu items are in-house cre- ations. I use time and love as their primary ingredients. All the spices and preparations of each dish compliment the others for a full-flavored BBQ experience.I love cooking and eating this food and I hope you enjoy it at least as much as I do. Thank you for choosing RE BBQ!",
