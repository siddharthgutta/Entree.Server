They offer a premium selection of their very own Michigan-born Piedmontese beef from free-range cattle that had descended directly from the Piedmont region of Italy. Monty\u2019s beef is completely hormone & antibiotic free, low in fat and cholesterol, and is naturally lean with a perfect tender texture. You can find this truck at special events and farmers markets throughout town, serving up beautifully delicious beef dishes; like burgers, brisket sandwiches, bolognese, meatballs, and more!
