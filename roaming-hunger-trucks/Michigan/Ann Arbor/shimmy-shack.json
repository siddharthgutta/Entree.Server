We want to show that veg food tastes, looks and smells awesome! We are not out to convert everyone to be vegetarians but we are out to encourage people to try to increase their intake of fruits and veggies a little bit every day. And for those of you who ARE vegetarians or vegans, we really really really hope you come to Shimmy Shack when you\u2019re craving a little something naughty \u2013 a  burger, fries and a shake or maybe some nachos!",
