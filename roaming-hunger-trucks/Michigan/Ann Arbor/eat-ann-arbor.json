  "description": "Our goal is to provide the best tasting food and the most personal catering that we can offer. We don't want people to feel like we're selling them something. We want people to feel like we are helping them with their event, that we're on their side. We recognize how important these functions are to our clients. We are happy to customize a menu to suit their needs. We want the food to not only be approachable, but flavorful and exciting. Food is inherently beautiful. We do not build 'food creations' or make dishes up, but allow carefully-sourced ingredients full expression within authentic food traditions. Locally sourced, traditionally-made food, prepared and served with attention to detail and care creates a sense of abundance and well-being that will make every eat event truly special and uniquely yours. This business is a natural extension of our commitment to community, to each other and to you.",
