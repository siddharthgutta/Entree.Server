  "description": "The Wandering Cow is a self-serve frozen yogurt & waffle food truck, based out of the Boulder/Denver area.The Wandering Cow is owned and operated by Boulder native Tyler Martini. After graduating from CU-Boulder with a degree in marketing in 2011, Tyler decided that now \u2014 before he became weighted down with life\u2019s many millstones \u2014 would be the best time to pursue his entrepreneurial dreams. Then, in a moment of semi-inspiration, he thought of combining the recent food-truck craze with the popularity of self-serve frozen yogurt, and The Wandering Cow was conceived. The Wandering Cow isn\u2019t the first self-serve frozen yogurt food truck in the country. However, we\u2019re pretty sure that it is the first, or at least the best, self-serve frozen yogurt truck that also serves Li\u00e8ge waffles.Tyler is passionate about both cooking and eating. So you can bet that it will be worth standing in line for any food served by The Wandering Cow.",
