Eat an entire spicy Helltown burger (served with meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and drenched in jalape\u00f1os, and habanero sauce) and you get your picture on their Wall of Fame. If you decide to volunteer a friend you can watch from the sidelines with a plate of nachos, a grilled cheese, or a juicy burger. ",
