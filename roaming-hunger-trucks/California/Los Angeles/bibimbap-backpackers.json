  "description": "For your next lunch, ditch the Big Mac and go for an equally quick and affordable yet vastly more nutritious and delicious bowl of BiBimBap from Backpackers\u2019 Food Truck. \u201cBiBim\u201d means \u201cmixing\u201d and \u201cBap\u201d means \u201csteamed rice\u201d in Korean. It\u2019s a bowl of rice topped with various vegetables (including spinach, bean sprouts, carrots, mushrooms, or lettuce, etc..) and topped with an egg or Korean BBQ. You then mix together your bowl with Gochujang (a vibrantly flavorful fermented red chili paste) and sesame oil, and then it\u2019s ready to be enjoyed. The Backpackers also like to refer to BiBimBap as a \u201cbowl of healthiness\u201d, which is perfectly accurate as it contains all the nutrients you need from a meal, with few calories. The profits go straight toward operating the Backpackers\u2019 educational program that teaches children all around Los Angeles about healthy eating.  For your next lunch, be sure to stop by the Backpackers\u2019 Truck and join in their pursuit of healthiness through tasty food!",
