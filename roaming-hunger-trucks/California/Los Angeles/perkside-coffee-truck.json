  "description": "This crew has been perking up LA for ten years, and by using only fair-trade & direct trade beans, Perkside Coffee Truck is certainly a trusty source for the best brews in town. Their refreshing and rejuvenating selection of espresso, lattes, coffee, milkshakes, and fresh fruit smoothies includes quite a few cool concoctions, including their creamy Vanilla Chai Chiller, or The Ultimate Fighter- a  flavorful force to be reckoned with- a smoothie with espresso, banana, peanut butter, whey protein, dates, almond milk, and a drop of honey...and there\u2019s much, much more. If you need to supply your guests at your next event with splendid sips, Perkside Coffee Truck is more than happy to provide a perfect solution. ",
