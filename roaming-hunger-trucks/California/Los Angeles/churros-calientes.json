  "description": "If this brightly colored red truck doesn't catch your attention, the smell of churros wafting to your nose will be sure to get you first in line for one of these delectable treats. Make sure to try their churros con chocolate, which come with a rich, thick chocolate drink to dip your churros in. Before dessert you can also grab a panini, bocadillo, soup, or salad! ",
