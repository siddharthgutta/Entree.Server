Why wouldn\u2019t it be when they\u2019re servin\u2019 up wondrous wraps with your choice of smoked Jerk Chicken, Mojo Shrimp, Slow-roasted Caribbean Pork, or Polynesian Marinated Steak? Mmmm. And with their tasty tacos, salads, and Island Seasoned Fries, it\u2019s no surprise that this Tropic Truck is the beach\u2019s top pick. ",
