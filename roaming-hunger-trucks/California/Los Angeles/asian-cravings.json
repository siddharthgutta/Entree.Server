  "description": "Asian Cravings is owned and operated by James Coffey & Lynn Truong, we love providing Asian-American fusion food for hungry Californians.Wanting to share our love for food from our multicultural backgrounds we've created a menu that integrates ingredients from those different countries into modern cuisines.  Combined we have over 30 years of experience in the food service industry.  Chef James started in the culinary industry at the age of 18 and became a sous chef at age 20.  Also, introduced to the food service industry at age 18, Lynn concentrated with the front of the house.  Lynn has been through serving, bartending, as well as management.  While acknowledging that they both have built pretty good resumes in the industry, in 2010, the two began to brainstorm about starting a business in the mobile gourmet food truck business.  The journey has started, but now the adventure begins\u2026",
