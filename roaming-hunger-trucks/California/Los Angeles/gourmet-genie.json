  "description": "The Gourmet Genie is often shocked by how man Mortals in Los Angeles are unfamiliar with the term \"Cal-Med\" or California-Mediterranean! The Mediterranean Region, where the Gourmet Genie (GG for short) hails from, is rich in exotic spices and both the people and genies incorporate them in their simple recipes: grilled meats, fresh salads and delicious side dishes with just a few ingredients.   The \"California\" part comes in because the Genie is a master of putting a modern and healthy (just like L.A.!) spin on this classic cuisine.We are certain you will love the food no matter where you come from.   And now you know why we call our cuisine \"Cal-Med\".  You heard it here first.  Don't be surprised when it catches on!",
