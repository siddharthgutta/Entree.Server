  "description": "Dogtown Dogs is the most compelling gourmet truck concept to emerge. The economic downturn is forcing diners to find quality alternatives to restaurant dining. Not willing to skimp on flavor and a sense of experience, our Foodies will have an opportunity to enjoy the best of everything at a fraction of the price.Each dog on the menu presents a sophisticated variation of traditional favorites with an innovative spin. Artful in presentation, the soulful flavors elicit a sense of nostalgia as you bite into the best dog of your life. A side of crispy tater tots becomes the ultimate accoutrement. Soy dogs are an available option for veggie lovers!MUST TRY: Spicy Algeleno - Bacon wrapped all beef dog topped with salsa fresca, tomatillo sauce and fried jalapenos. To read about the experience of serving on this truck, and why food truck operators are just about the hardest workers there are, check out the blog post on Roaming Hunger here: http://roaminghunger.com/blog/4471/its-a-dog-eat-dog-world",
