  "description": "The LA streets have never been sweeter as the Vern\u2019s crew takes this bright orange truck through town, scooping up delicious organic ice creams and vegan ices that truly delight everyone around. Using the finest locally sourced ingredients, Vern\u2019s offers a scrumptious selection of truck-made flavors like The Elvis (banana flavored ice cream with peanut butter swirls and mini organic semi sweet morsels), Guinness Cake (heavenly vanilla ice cream with chunks of chocolate cake made with Guinness stout and a chocolate Jameson ganache swirl), Blueberry ala Mode (vanilla ice cream with layers of blueberry pie filling and crispy pie crust), and many more. You also must try their sensationally refreshing Cherry Italian Ice. These cold creamy treats are perfect for every occasion, so be sure to invite Vern\u2019s to your next event so that you and your guests can share in some flavorful fun!",
