This is Not Your Mamas Kitchen, and they're here to bring real flavor to the streets of Los Angeles. You've never had fried fish, chicken, fries, or anything else as satisfying as what these chefs are making for you. We just know that this truck will have you coming back again and again, even if it's only because you keep emptying your plate before you reach your table!",
