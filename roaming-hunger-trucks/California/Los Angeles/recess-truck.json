Travel back in time to the days of recess on the monkey bars, and delicious frozen treats with the Recess Truck in Los Angeles! Their ice cream is made with high quality natural ingredients that are sweetened with pure cane sugar. Enjoy the flavors of classic vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, coffee, and many many more!",
