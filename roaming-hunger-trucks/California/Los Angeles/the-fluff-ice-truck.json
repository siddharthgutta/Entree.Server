  "description": "Recently named Zagat\u2019s LA Food Truck of the Week, our adorable Fluff Ice Truck is now roaming the streets of LA peddling our unique twist on the traditional shave ice dessert. As the name suggests, Fluff Ice is fluffy. We take the traditional shave ice process and turn it upside down. By pre-flavoring our ice blocks before we shave them, we are able to create whole ribbon-like sheets of Fluff Ice that is not only light in texture but amazing in taste. We are constantly rotating our menu on the truck with the menu at our store in Monterey Park, CA. Look for us at your local food truck event, farmer\u2019s market, or community event!To learn about the creation of the truck, why it's always good to have friends in the food truck community, and what Fluff Ice means when they say \"edible plastic,\" read Roaming Hunger's blog here: http://roaminghunger.com/blog/4581/what-the-fluff",
