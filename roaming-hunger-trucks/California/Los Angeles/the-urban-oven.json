  "description": "Living a few blocks away from one of the greatest pizzerias in the world had quite a lasting effect on Scott Tremonti, who spent decades near the world renowned Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix, AZ. This experience lit a fire in his belly that just could not be put out. At a young age, he began his lifelong quest to create his own authentic Neapolitan style wood fired artisan pizza. After years of experience and training by some of today's best pizzaiolos, Scott is ready to share his authentic, made fresh to order pizzas with the people of LA. Now with his custom-built mobile food truck with an actual wood-fired oven, he too can inspire every Los Angeleno who eats his delicious pizza. ",
