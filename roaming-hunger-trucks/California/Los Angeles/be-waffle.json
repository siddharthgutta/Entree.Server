  "description": "Be Waffle is a delicious waffle truck serving the streets of Los Angeles. These Li\u00e8ge waffles are soft inside and crunchy on the outside; the chipped sugar caramelizes during the cooking process to create a delectable surface which can then be adorned with red fruit coulis, a ball of vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, or the sweet and simple icing sugar. Find this fantastic truck on the streets of LA and get yourself a waffle today!",
