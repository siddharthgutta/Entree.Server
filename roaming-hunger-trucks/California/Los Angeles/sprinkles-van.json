  "description": "The very famous Sprinkles cupcakes now offered on the go!Street food never tasted so sweet as eating Red Velvet cupcakes curbside. Where's the milk-mobile?My great grandmother was renowned for the distinctive desserts she made at her San Francisco restaurant during the 1930's. She created pure, delicious, uncomplicated pastries \u2013 the result of her French culinary roots and her new American working life. These days, as I sift, whisk and frost at the bakery I began with my husband in Beverly Hills, I imagine our scratch-based cupcakes as a natural extension of my great grandmother's legacy.As we continue the tradition of simple and satisfying desserts handcrafted from the best ingredients \u2013 not too precious, always just right \u2013 our hope is that Sprinkles Cupcakes will conjure up lovely memories of your own childhood or family, or simply the pleasure of good taste.",
