  "description": "Jersey Dogs is a family operation. It's myself and my husband Scott. We are very active in the community, working a number of youth sports, camps, schools, food truck  and fundraising events.   As for our food - Jersey Dogs serves Sabrett 100% All-Beef Hot Dogs (the brand of Hot Dogs you'd find on every corner in NY). We offer some signature (Spicy, Horseradish-based Relish) and standard (Sauerkraut, Red Onion Sauce, etc) toppings. (We also offer Polish, Spicy, Vegetarian and Turkey Dog options.) We now have Soft pretzels too. Stop by and have a bite!",
