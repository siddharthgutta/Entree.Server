  "description": "Let's be Frank was founded by two fast food visionaries, Sue Moore and Larry Bain, who joined forces to return the much-demeaned hot dog to its rightful position: an icon for a healthy food system. Their goal was to make food that nourishes both eaters and growers, serving franks that are free from hormones, antibiotics, nitrates, and nitrites, and supporting the ever-shrinking group of family farmers and ranchers committed to raising their animals in a humane, conscientious, and healthy manner. Their mission proved to be instantly successful as their delicious hot dogs frankly gained many a foodie fan. From their family-farmed pork bratwurst, to spicy \"hot\" dog, to their signature Devil Sauce (a diabolically delectable spicy condiment), each of their tasty products reflect their commitment to ensuring that Let's be Frank is really the home of dogs gone good.",
