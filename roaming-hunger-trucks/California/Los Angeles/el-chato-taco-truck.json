  "description": "Rated as the Best Taco Truck by LA Weekly (which is really quite a feat since the competition is particularly fierce on these streets), El Chato Taco Truck is local legend for their deliciously simple selection of tacos, burritos, and quesadillas, stuffed with a tasty variety of meats & veggies, like Asada, Pastor, Pollo, Chorizo, and so much more. Their salsas are robust, their veggies are crisp & fresh, their meats are juicy and flavorful, their tortillas are soft and warm...it\u2019s no wonder why all of LA just loooooooves this truck. These mouthwatering Mexican eats make for the best meal any time of day, especially because these wonderful $1 tacos absolutely hit the spot, and on the super cheap too, but late at night is especially delightful when you're out on the town.For an authentic and scrumptious LA food truck experience, El Chato Taco Truck is a definite must-try.
