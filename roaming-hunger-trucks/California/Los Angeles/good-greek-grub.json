  "description": "Who are the faces behind Good Greek Grub? Dino Pantazis and Vasilis \"Billy\" Petrou. We both had an idea to bring our knowledge of cooking, the restaurant business and the love of eating Greek food to the people of Los Angeles. Our Gyros are the Souvlaki Gyros (Shish Kabob Gyros) you'd find in Greece. We refused to serve our customers mystery meat shaped into a cone . After many attempts at different recipes and many many Gyros eaten in Greece (we did it for the people) we came up with flavors that are mouth watering good. The pork souvlaki is our speciality. Not to say the rest of the food isn't as delicious but it's the one we're most proud of..... Our \"claim to fame.\" We hope all of our FB friends have a chance to try our food and find out for themselves. And don't forget to try out Saganaki Bites! Created by us and sold only on the G3 truck!Thanks for supporting us and see you around!",
