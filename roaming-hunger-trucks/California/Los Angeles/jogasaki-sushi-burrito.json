  "description": "Only in LA could a beautiful fusion of Mexican street food and Japanese cuisine originate, and it\u2019s all thanks to this eye-catching truck with the sombrero-donning samurai. As Jogasaki rolls through the city, its team rolls up big burritos stuffed with delicious sushi fixings that busy commuters can enjoy on the go. Their signature burrito creations include crisp cucumber, slices of fresh avocado, and a combination of your choice of luscious crab meat, spicy tuna, BBQ eel, baked Langostino lobster, or shrimp tempura, which is all wrapped snuggly in rice and sesame seed-speckled soy paper. Their menu also offers innovative items like the Spicy Tuna Nachos (with spicy tuna, avocado and eel sauce, all piled high on a bed of Doritos) or the Salmon Ceviche Taco (with salmon sashimi and pico de gallo, dressed with tangy ponzu and yuzu dressing). For all this and much more, you gotta get yourself over to Jogasaki soon!",
