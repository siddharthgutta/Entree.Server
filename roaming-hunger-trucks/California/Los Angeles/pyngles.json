  "description": "What food do you see around your neighborhood on a daily basis?  Is it healthy, fresh, and sustainable? Food, and how we interact with it, is a habit that is learned over time and passed down from generation to generation.   When we live in a world where the quick and easy fix of the Dollar Menu is on every corner, and one-third of U.S. adults (35.7%)* are obese, it becomes more and more clear that we need to be the ones who affect real change within our communities. Pyngle's mission is clear -- to bring healthy and sustainable eating alternatives to the community.",
