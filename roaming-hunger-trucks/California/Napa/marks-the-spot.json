  "description": "City: NapaMark is a Kiwi and a trained chef.He\u2019s cooked all over the world in New Zealand, Australia, London, Spain and Sonoma. He was even an opening chef for the famous Roxanne\u2019s Living Foods restaurant in Larkspur.For the last five years Mark\u2019s been working in the wine industry and has done everything from Cellar Rat and Tasting Room Manager, to Winery Chef and National Sales.He really enjoyed his time at family wineries, but he\u2019s a chef at heart and wanted to get back to cooking full time. The problem was, with a new baby at home, he didn\u2019t want to go back to the hours and the grind of a fine dining restaurant.So\u2026 he started a fine food truck. He serves breakfast and lunch, caters the occasional special event, and is home in time for dinner.Mark is pleased to offer hand-made, farm fresh, locally sourced, mostly organic food served in biodegradable and earth friendly packaging, and looks forward to serving you!",
