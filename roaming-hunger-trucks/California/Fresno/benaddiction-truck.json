  "description": "If you loves eggs benedict, this truck is heaven on earth. They are serving up a number of different eggs benedict sandwiches on english muffins and topped with homemade hollandaise sauce. If you look at the menu you'll notice that each item is named after a song by various bands. If you can name all of these bands you may just get a free snack. Too late for breakfast? They've got sandwiches too, ranging from pulled pork to a crab melt. ",
