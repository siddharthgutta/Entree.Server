  "description": "Del Popolo is a mobile pizzeria committed to creating rustic Neopolitan-inspired pizza using ingredients sourced from small, generational producers. Del Popolo is housed in a twenty-foot transatlantic shipping container that's been re-purposed and modified into a kitchen. A wall of glass doors exposes the interior, including the traditional Italian-made wood-fired oven.",
