  "description": "Sunrise Deli, open since 1984 and now expanded to four Bay Area locations, including the recently-opened SF locale at 89 Belden Place, is as authentic as it gets - the falafel, shawarma, kabobs, hummus and babaghanouj are what bring locals back on a regular basis to this casual lunch and dinner gem. Sunrise Deli is proud to serve Halal meat and fresh, local produce.",
