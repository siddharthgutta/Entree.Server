We have taken our family recipes from Argentina, and combined them with the technique of our French culinary training and the amazing ingredients of Northern California to make the best empanadas in the Bay Area.  El Sur's mission is to preserve the artisanal way of making empanadas and to serve them to you the only way an empanada should be eaten, directly from the oven.",
