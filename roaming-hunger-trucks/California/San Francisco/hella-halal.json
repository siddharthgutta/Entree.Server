  "description": "Hella Halal has taken the West Coast by storm with their NY Dish with a SF Twist. Everyone adores their authentic Middle Eastern menu, made with a little California Love AKA ingredients sourced from local farmers markets, and sriracha sauce!Their selection includes the classic Hella Halal Platter- Beef/Chicken gyro (or hummus) with saffron basmati rice, and a side salad drizzled with their signature white & red sauce, and a side of toasted pita. You can even get these fixins' wrapped in a warm tortilla, and enjoy yourself a terrific Halal Taco. For all this and much more, you just have to come out to Off the Grid, and you\u2019ll be giving the crew at Hella Halal a happy high-five for their heavenly cuisine. ",
