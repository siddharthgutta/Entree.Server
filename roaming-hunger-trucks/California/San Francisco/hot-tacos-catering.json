  "description": "This truck is run by a loving family with a passion for food. They\u2019ve taken the traditional flavors found in Michoac\u00e1, fused them with fresh California ingredients, and are treating San Franciscans to their made-from-scratch, authentic, and incredibly tasty creations. Their menu includes a savory selection of meats; slow-cooked Carnitas, robust Barbacoa, juicy marinated chicken, and plump grilled shrimp, which can be served as tacos, burritos, or quesadillas. For all this and much more, call on Hot Tacos to cater your next occasion. ",
