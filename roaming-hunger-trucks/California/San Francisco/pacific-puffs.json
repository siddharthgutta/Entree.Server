As an old family recipe, the cream puff has been our favorite dessert for as long as we can remember.  A cream puff was always the special treat we looked forward to most on birthdays and special occasions. It is now our pleasure to offer our favorite dessert every day of the week!Pacific Puffs is proud to be family owned and operated.",
