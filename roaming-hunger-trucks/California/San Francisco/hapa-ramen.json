  "description": "Hapa Ramen makes a unique bowl of noodles, using locally sourced, organic ingredients, and modern cooking techniques.We use the good stuff: Organically raised pork, chickens that enjoyed roaming around their pastures, and locally sourced konbu.  We also use seasonal, local vegetables from the best farms\u2014Catalan, Dirty Girl, Star Route, Serendipity, Knoll, and Marin Roots, to name a few. Perhaps you have read Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma and watched Food Inc., now realizing that local, organic is the way to go with food. For us, the reasons are even simpler: it tastes way better and we want to support the local farmer to complete the circle for the local economy.",
