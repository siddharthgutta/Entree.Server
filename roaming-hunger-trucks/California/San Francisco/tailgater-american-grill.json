  "description": "Tailgater American Grill is a mobile food trailer/catering business. They specialize in grilled food such as gourmet burgers, pulled pork, ribs, chicken, Tri-tip, and even fish. Their signature item is the tailgater burger:grass-fed beef patty on toasted bun with pepper jack cheese, Cajun mayo, jalape\u00f1os, and lettuce/tomato, but we always have some new and exciting entree for the week.  They also have fabulous salads and sides. A couple of example of them are:  red potato salad with blue cheese, finely chopped green onion, and olives with a little spicy dressing or our \"adult\" Mac-n-cheese with three cheeses, jalape\u00f1o, and applewood smoked bacon. Yum!!   Try an awesome peanut butter/ dark chocolate cookie for desert  too!In addition they also make breakfast and have a great fried egg, cheese, and applewood smoke bacon sandwich or French toast fingers with maple syrup and powdered sugar.
