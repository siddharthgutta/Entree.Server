  "description": "Rolling in San Francisco, 3-SUM EATS is the brain-child of Ryan Scott, who having lived in such an eclectic city, felt that everyone deserves to enjoy street food that is worthy of the residents within; fresh, fast, unique, and hip. The concept is simple: Get Sauced, Tossed, & Sandwiched with a daily choice of 3 freshly prepared sandwiches; a fried item, soup, salad, and a delectable dessert, of course. For the highest quality and value you can find on the streets, get yourself some 3-Sum Eats. ",
