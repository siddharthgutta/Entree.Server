  "description": "Red Rooster Tacos is a new brand but by far not new to the business of food trucks! We have 19 years of experience and with Red Rooster we are bringing a modern twist to the traditional Mexican Taco truck but keeping the same authentic taste that everyone loves. We specialize in corporate catering or events as well as private customer events. We pride ourselves on our customer service and we love what we do.  We will be joining the food truck circuits soon so keep an eye out for us and we look forward to partying with you soon!",
