  "description": "Dum is inspired by the soul food of the Indian cuisine; a combination of food that was once considered fit for the royals, and food that is most commonly served on the streets of India. Every city has a different version of street food, in this case the flavors are bold and the textures varied - it is sweet, spicy, sour, crunchy, salty, and every bite is a unique experience. Dum is a new interpretation of Indian cuisine, served with thought and care. Check it out!",
