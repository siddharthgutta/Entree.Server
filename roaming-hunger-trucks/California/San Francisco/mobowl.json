  "description": "MoBowl came to life because we believe that eating a great meal on the streets didn't mean you had to sacrifice quality and convenience for price. They do it all over the world and we aim to do the same here in the Bay Area!Think of us as a moving restaurant that serves freshly made wholesome food in a bowl. We promise to fill you up with affordable options that offer a distinctly Chinese & California character to it.It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve never eaten a rice bowl before or you are someone that eats rice every day, we are here to further the fact that 'street' food can also mean delicious and affordable foods together.We hope that we have something that\u2019ll fit your tastes. If we don\u2019t, talk to us and we\u2019ll do what we can to fix it! That's what MoBowl is all about. Our hope is that we will create food that you can afford, appreciate, and share with your loved ones.",
