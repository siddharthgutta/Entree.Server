  "description": "Pronounced [see-sig]Sisig is a traditional Filipino method of preparing meat. The meat is diced and saut\u00e9ed with onions, soy sauce, vinegar, lemon juice, jalape\u00f1os and seasoned with salt, pepper, and other spices. Sisig is truly one of the Philippines most delicious dishes and we at Se\u00f1or Sisig taco truck take pride in serving its addicting flavor to the Bay Area. Plus it\u2019s great in a taco!Founded by Daly City natives Gil and Evan, one of whom went to a culinary academy, the other of whom got his MBA, this truck seems an unlikely creation. To the childhood friends, however, it just made sense. A way to share an amazing food that just doesn't see enough attention? How could they not!
