  "description": "We Love Great DeliThe New York on Rye gourmet food truck serves Deli like you\u2019ve never had it. Homemade, handmade, from scratch: no matter how you say it, that\u2019s what we do to make a better sandwich. Presenting New York on Rye, the best deli food west of NYC. We make our own mustards, dressings, horseradish, and fries. No store-bought coleslaw for you! We\u2019ve sourced the best locally available meats, cheeses, vegetables and fruits, because your taste buds deserve nothing less.Ever wonder why folks from \u201cBack East\u201d get misty-eyed thinking about their favorite pastrami? You need a terrific navel: beef navel. It has the best marbling for the trials and tribulations of becoming great pastrami. Lots of delis try to pass off other cuts of beef done \u201cpastrami style\u201d, like brisket, or (heaven forbid), top round. After a relaxing two-week bath in special brine, pastrami is hung to dry for another day, slow smoked, and if you\u2019re lucky, steamed to tender perfection. It can be sublime. Just like grandma did it back in the old country.We\u2019ve given the same consideration to each ingredient and every recipe we offer. We\u2019re foodies. We love to eat good food. But we prefer great food. So we\u2019ll only bring you a great deli experience. That\u2019s how we roll. We\u2019re roaming the streets and office plazas of San Diego\u2019s north county every weekdayIt\u2019s in the cure. It\u2019s in the smoke. It\u2019s in the meat. That\u2019s only at New York On Rye.",
