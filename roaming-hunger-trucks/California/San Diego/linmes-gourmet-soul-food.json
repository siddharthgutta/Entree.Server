Family owned and operated,  Linme's soul food comes from 110 years of family recipes, from my great grandmother, grandmothers, mother and father.  Our inspiration to cook comes from our guests' priceless joy when eating.  Blessed to be a blessing, we also feed the homeless, weekly.  We give all honor, praise, thanksgiving, and glory to the Lord in Jesus' Name.",
