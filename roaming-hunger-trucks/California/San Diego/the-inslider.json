  "description": "What Is TheInslider?TheInslider is San Diego\u2019s newest food truck addiction, serving gourmet burgers and sides on the go.Have you ever visited a restaurant and simply could not decide which single item to order? We know the feeling. It is that desire to try a little bit of everything that inspired the concept behind The InSlider.Driven by variety, our first steps were to ask for input from the community on an assortment of topics from our name to colors for the truck. We then united a team with diverse experience in culinary, business and creative ventures. After much anticipation, and months spent developing the menu/preparing the truck \u2013 TheInslider hit the streets in March 2012. We\u2019ve been serving up gourmet sliders and fries all over San Diego ever since.Community, sharing, variety, and a love for unique, tasty food have inspired us to embark on this culinary adventure. Come join us!",
