  "description": "Ladies and Gentlemen, boys and girls, of San Diego, Kona Ice is supplying fun frozen treats that are hands down the best way to enjoy summer eats. Signature KEVs (Kona Entertainment Vehicles) have paved the way for shaved ice mobiles all over the country since they first washed ashore in Kentucky in 2007. With tropical tunes and the freedom to choose your flavors, this cool idea warmed the hearts of Americans, and now you can find colorful KEVs surfing up everywhere, including the beaches near you. So come cool off the Kona way, with refreshing shaved ice and your Flavorwave faves. ",
