  "description": "Suite 106 Cupcakery was established in 2007 by owner Christiana Grammer. Christiana worked in her family's financial business before deciding to follow her passion for baking full time. As a young child she remembers watching her mother bake delectable desserts from scratch for Sunday dinners. Christiana utilizes the skill baking from scratch from her mother and has incorporated gourmet, organic and all natural ingredients along with artisan techniques to her mouth watering recipes.  In 2007 Suite 106 Cupcakery became the first cupcake-only business in the Inland Empire and one of the first in Southern California. They started out as a small cupcake catering company, catering events and weddings throughout Southern California. They also shared space and sold their cupcakes at 2 different retail locations within the Inland Empire, this is when they started to grow a name for themselves in the community. Later Suite 106 Cupcakery branched out to sell their cupcakes online where they delivered and shipped their goods nationwide.Today Suite 106 Cupcakery Won the first season of the Food Networks hit Series Cupcake Wars and has also competed in Cupcake Wars season three \"Battle Of The Champs\".
