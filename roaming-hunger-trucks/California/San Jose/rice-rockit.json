  "description": "Rice Rockit started as a crazy dream among friends early in 2011. We\u2019re all foodies, and a few of our families have owned restaurants for many years. And with this huge movement of food on wheels sweeping the nation, we really wanted to be a part of it! It\u2019s such a great avenue to showcase really good food. In the past, opening a restaurant was so expensive, risky, time consuming, convoluted, tedious, stress inducing, and you were lucky to make it past a year. But with this new movement, its no longer location, location, location \u2013 it\u2019s about FOOD! If you cook it well and make it taste great, they will come\u2026 and better yet we can drive it to them! So we sobered up a bit and we got serious about our venture. We knew we wanted to be original and creative not with just our name, theme, and truck \u2013 but most importantly with our food. Growing up in Silicon Valley, we had the privilege of being in a wonderfully diverse community surrounded by great restaurants with flavors from all over the world. We wanted to take our favorite dishes, the food that we grew up with, and put a slight spin on it to make it fun, new, and exciting. So Fast Furios Fusion!So how did we come up with the theme?We wanted to be different, and light-hearted about the whole experience. Food should be fun and that\u2019s the direction we took. We asked ourselves, what would be outrageous and what hasn\u2019t been done before? Well we all grew up in the 90\u2032s when import racing was just getting started. So we decided to incorporate that somehow with our business, and that really put us on the import racing direction.How did you come up with the name, Rice Rockit?So first off, we know the spelling is not the correct way to spell rocket. LOL So let us explain. When we went with the import racing theme, we wanted a cool and clever name. So who hasn\u2019t heard of the term Rice Rocket? We all love rice\u2026and on top of that one of us has been a DJ for over a decade, so we wanted to incorporate music with the theme. Hence forth, and therefore \u2013 in summary \u2013 We came up with Rice RockIt. Oh yeah BTW we love Star Wars too, so that was a plus. =)What in the world did you guys do to the truck?We pulled out all the stops in getting the truck the way we wanted it. We took the extra time (months and months) to redo it almost from scratch. So imagine, Xzibit stealing our Honda Civic and say \u201cYo dawg, I heard you like to cook \u2013 so I\u2019m putting a full kitchen into your ride, with a crazy sound system and crazy lighting.\u201d That\u2019s pretty much what we did. And with the help of our friends from Audio Design and (Marty\u2019s Chop Shop) \u2013 we overhauled our little old truck into what it is today.Who are you guys?We\u2019re just a group of guys who always get drunk at a neighborhood bar and love food. We\u2019re an Engineer, a Chef, Business Owners, and a DJ. It\u2019s a great Silicon Valley combo. With this combination we plan to deliver great food and sick beats for your diverse EATS!!",
