We bring the taste of authentic Liege and Brussels waffles to you!Greetings!  My name is Judy Vandoorne, and we started Waffle Amore to bring the taste of authentic Liege and Brussels waffles to you.We\u2019ll be offering a variety of toppings, such as strawberries, bananas, whipped cream, Belgian Chocolate Hot Fudge, Maple Bacon Butter, Speculoos, and other sweet and savory creations!To give you a sense of my dedication to creating some of the finest waffles for you, we have spent considerable time training in Belgium learning old-world techniques, working both at the manufacturer\u2019s headquarters, as well as a number of the  local Farmer\u2019s Markets near Aalst, honing and refining my waffle-making skills along the way.  We\u2019ve even purchased a custom waffle oven and had it imported from Belgium to help us craft an authentic waffle experience!I can\u2019t wait to meet you, and share the flavor of these waffles with you!  We\u2019ll see you soon!- Judy",
