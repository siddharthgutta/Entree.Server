  "description": "Yummi BBQ is an expression of our love of food.  Our business started with 1 recipe, the bbq beef short rib that our father created almost 25 years ago. A popular dish frequently requested from family members and friends during parties. The menu we serve is an adaptation of this recipe which brings together our food experiences living in San Francisco and the Bay Area specific to Asian flavors.As Filipinos living in SF, we were exposed to a myriad of flavors but the ones that sing in our palate the most is all the Asian flavors ranging from Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Cambodian.  Our ingredients reflect a combination of flavor profiles in one dish.Many trucks have one specific flavor profile but ours combines many of the Asian cultures in one dish primarily served bbq style. Our goal is to share our passion of food to everyone, one Yummi BBQ bite at a time...",
