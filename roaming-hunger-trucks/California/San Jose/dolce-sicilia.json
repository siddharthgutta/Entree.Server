  "description": "2008 marked the beginning of an incredible journey for the Federico family, both personally and professionally.After moving from Sicily to the Silicon Valley, we noticed there was a void for traditional Italiandesserts, and that many Italian classics had morphed in name, form and ingredients (for example,\"Cantucci\", a staple in Italian patisserie, had been renamed \"biscotti\" -which simply translates into\"cookies\" in Italian, and had lost some ingredients in the process)...it inspired us to start a familycompany that would bring back traditional recipes from our native Sicily right to the heart of theSilicon Valley. At Dolce Sicilia, we are passionate about quality, and believe that it all starts with primeingredients, which are hand crafted to perfection following our family recipes to create confectioneryproducts that will surely captivate your taste buds. Enjoy!",
