  "description": "3-3-3 is a catering food truck with its beginnings started by 2 childhood friends from the Bay Area. Always at a loss as to where to eat that's healthy and affordable, these friends realized a food truck was a great way to deliver exactly that.Kitchen layout was custom built with a full line of high BTU commercial equipment ready for battle!Lunch and dinner shifts are provided offering a savory variety of tacos and burritos made from scratch for a healthy meal that taste buds can rock with.Keeping true to the belief that food is at its best when made from scratch with no fillers or doctored short cuts, company was built upon the same approach. Team composition, menu design, company logo, recipes, food photos, websites, kitchen blueprints, as well as the truck's characters were all made from scratch!For larger catering events, our kitchen also offers off menu choices as well.Whether it's a fundraiser, a private party, a corporate event, or a life-changing celebration, 3-3-3 has something to offer.Portable kitchen anyone? 3-3-3 is ready to serve",
