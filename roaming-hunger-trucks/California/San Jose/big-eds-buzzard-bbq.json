While you\u2019re always welcome to stop by their restaurant to indulge in the buzzworthy bliss, they can also bring the BBQ to you in their big black truck. Big Ed and his wife Debra dreamt of serving their community incredible food with a side of warm, personable service. The folks of San Jose have embraced their vision with arms wide open and now this BBQ business is booming. Come out and fork up some local favorites, including their pulled pork sandwiches, BBQ Wings, and Tri-Tip Plate (to name a few). Prepare yourself for their tasty, tangy sauces and delicious sides. Head on over to Big Ed\u2019s and you\u2019ll buzz for this \u2018Q, too! ",
