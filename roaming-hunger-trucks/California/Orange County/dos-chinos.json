  "description": "Southern California raised us on Asian and Mexican food. Its what were made of - every sinew is built on years of carne asada burritos, even our heart pumps wholesome goodness of beef broth from Vietnamese pho. We delight in what our mother, Southern California, has offered us and thank her for feeding us such a delicious variety of food. Its time we give back and contribute. We want to offer the best of both culinary worlds that we grew up loving so much. Dos Chinos Food Truck just doesn't want to offer Asian street food wrapped up in tortillas, but we want to give people a true marriage of Latin and Asian flavors. We believe that these flavor profiles are destined to be together. You will too!",
