  "description": "The chefs behind Tacos El Balcon began serving delicious Mexican cuisine to their neighbors and friends from their balcony over ten years ago. They loved the tradition of sharing good times together and eventually decided to take their authentic recipes for tasty tacos and try trucking them around Orange County to befriend even more new fans of their flavorful fare. Thus this truck was born. With top-quality meats including Asada, Chorizo, Adobada, and more, it\u2019s no wonder that everyone finds it to be such a special treat to eat from Tacos El Balcon. ",
