  "description": "Serving up a variety of Smokin\u2019 Tri-Tip sandwiches and other cowboy grub, the Tri Tip Man Truck waits for you on the streets of Orange County. The tri-tip is not your typical Santa Maria fare; instead it is marinated in a special \u201cKickin\u2019 Cowboy Rub\u201d, a coffee-based blend of spices. To top it off, instead of grilling over red oak, the beef is smoked over pecan wood, resulting in an amazing flavor. Try it today!",
