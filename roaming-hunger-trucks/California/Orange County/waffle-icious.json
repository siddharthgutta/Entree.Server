  "description": "Authentic Liege Waffles with a variety of sweet and savory toppingsLiege waffles (from the city of Liege, in eastern Belgium) are the most popular waffles in Belgium. These tasty treats are sold by street vendors and are a delightful anytime snack.Our Liege waffles are made from house made dough using the finest ingredients. We use imported Belgian pearl sugar and pure vanilla extract.  The Pearl sugar is caramelized when baked using a traditional Liege waffle iron. This gives the outside of the waffle a wonderful flavor and crunch. Liege waffles have been enjoyed throughout Europe for centuries and are a true indulgence to savor.",
