This talented team is grilling up a mouthwatering selection of premium burgers, like The Chinook (\u2153 lb. American-Kobe beef burger with garlic aioli, cheddar, lettuce, and tomato on a fresh-baked Brioche bun), and other classically satisfying cuisine, like Mac \u2018N\u2019 Cheese with bacon and hot wings.

And for dessert, don\u2019t forget to dig into their Salted Caramel Bacon Brownie...mmm...For all this and much, much more, come check out The Lobos Truck for a mobile meal you\u2019re sure to love.
