We set out to create Falasophy to provide our interpretation of exciting cravable street food and offering it using the highest quality and the freshest ingredients possible.  Our menu is focused on falafel and hummus along with accompanying sides and salads and as such is all vegetarian and mostly vegan. We are dedicated to providing the best tasting falafel sandwich and hummus period. Everything we serve is made from scratch and all natural. ",
