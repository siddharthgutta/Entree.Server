Our menu currently consists of gourmet handcrafted burgers and tacos. We use Chuck to make our signature grind for our burgers and Sirloin flap meat for our tacos. We also cut potatoes fresh on the truck for fries and fry up handmade tortillas for our crisp tortilla chips. We would be happy to customize our menu to fit your event!",
