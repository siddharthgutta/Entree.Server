  "description": "Stuff n It Burgers + More was started in 2011 by friends who wanted more from and in their burgers.  After years of trying, tasting and eating different ingredients topped on burgers, we had tried every conceivable option.  We wanted to do something different, so we decided to infuse the burger and stuff it with various ingredients, from spinach, to cheese, to pastrami, to chili.  After trying many different variations, we decided to share our creations with you.  After you have tried other burgers with stuff on it, come try our burgers, and you will realize you will always want  Stuff n It Burgers.",
