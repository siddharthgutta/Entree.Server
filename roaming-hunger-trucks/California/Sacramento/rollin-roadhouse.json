You can find this truck ridin\u2019 around town, rollin\u2019 out bonafide sliders, slow-roasted meats, all complete with their signature homemade BBQ sauce. And of course, as you\u2019d expect in America\u2019s Farm-to-Fork capital, Rollin Roadhouse is rockin\u2019 it with their home-smoked pork.  For some quality comfort cuisine, make it a goal to hit up Rollin Roadhouse. ",
