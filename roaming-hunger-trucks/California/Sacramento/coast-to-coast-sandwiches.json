  "description": "Coast To Coast Sandwiches was started by two culinary school buddies who loved to talk about best sandwiches in the United States. They were well-traveled and knew all about great comfort food. And since they couldn\u2019t find the sandwiches they wanted in Sacramento, they decided to do it themselves. With the skills to create specialty sandwiches and a food truck to take them places, Coast To Coast Sandwiches can do any event that needs comfort sandwiches done well!",
