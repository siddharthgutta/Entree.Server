  "description": "DavePops and LukePops are a new frozen novelty made from a new process called duBle\u2019. They are soft and creamy like ice cream, but do not need the addition of fats or dairy to achieve an ice cream like texture. In fact they are made in an entirely new way that does not use ice cream equipment.Since DavePops and LukePops do not use ice cream equipment they can be made from all most anything, whole fruits, juices, soy milk, almond milk, teas, sodas even energy drinks. Try one of these delicious concoctions today!",
