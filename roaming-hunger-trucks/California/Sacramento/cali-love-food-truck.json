His selection of sandwiches, sliders, and sides are made with fresh and local ingredients, slow-smoked meats, and copious quality. From the NorCal Reuben (with corned beef, spicy kimchi, swiss cheese, truck-made Russian dressing on grilled sourdough) to the Diner Burger (with perfectly seasoned Angus ground chuck, short rib, & brisket, topped with 18 month aged white cheddar, bacon, pickle, and Russian dressing) to black truffle-infused fries...when you try anything from this incredible truck, you\u2019ll certainly be feeling the Cali Love.
