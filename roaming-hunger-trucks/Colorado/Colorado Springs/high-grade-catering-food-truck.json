His authentic menu offers a selection of tender marinated Jerk chicken and pork, and Island spiced Curry dishes with your choice of meat, atop deliciously savory & sweet coconut rice. A few of the mouthwatering sides include yummy curly or funnel cake fries, sweet fried plantains, and fresh hot and creamy fried macaroni & cheese. With all this and more, High Grade Catering & Food Truck is simply the perfect choice for your next party or feast. ",
