  "description": "Have you noticed that Texas, the Carolinas, Memphis, and Kansas City all hog the barbeque glory? No longer able to accept that Colorado was being left out, this crew took a stand and hatched a genius plan:Take delicious smoked meat, toss the sauce, and add hatch green chiles for the perfect amount of heat. Now they\u2019re about to tow this happy little camper around town to debut Colorado-style \u2018Q!Curating the highest quality ingredients, they offer a simple selection of delectable dishes. They hand-cut their fries fresh, and when they pile on smoked pulled pork, homemade green chili, and cream cheese, it\u2019s really no wonder why this Colorado Poutine is puttin\u2019 smiles on campers everywhere. If you want to ditch the meat but keep the heat, there are tasty vegan and vegetarian options too. You\u2019ve got to come try all their creative cuisine, and make it snappy, because once you experience Colorado BBQ for the first time, you\u2019ll feel pretty dang happy. ",
