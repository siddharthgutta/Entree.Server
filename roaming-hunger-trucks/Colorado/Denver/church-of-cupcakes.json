  "description": "This beautifully restored 1976 VW Bus is bringing worship-worthy cupcakes and divine house-made soft serve ice cream through the streets of Denver. Their entire menu is made with organic, local, and 100% all natural ingredients! If the heavens wouldn't smile upon it, it's not in their treats (as in, they use no synthetic colors or flavors). Church of Cupcakes is available for private events and public events!  \u201cElsa\u201d, their wonderful truck, is only 15 feet long so it can easily fit in smaller spaces/regular parking spots.  Call on Church of Cupcakes to come cater because these lovingly handcrafted sweets are sure to bring smiles to your face and joy to your soul.  ",
