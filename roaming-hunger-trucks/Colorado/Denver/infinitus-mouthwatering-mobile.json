  "description": "Our mouthwatering iPIE mobile pre-dates our stores! It is the original iPIE. Katie PIE started workin' dat truck when she was a wee-little-lady at the Lyon's music festivals. It has since bought the family a trampoline paid for college tuition, weddings, vacations and much more! We serve 8 inch individual pizza PIE's (we call them iPIE's) in 10 minutes or less. Everybody gets exactly what they want. Katie PIE is now 27 and on a mission. ",
