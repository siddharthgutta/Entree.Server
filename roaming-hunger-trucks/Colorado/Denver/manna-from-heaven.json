  "description": "Manna From Heaven is a Colorado based Mobile Gourmet Food Truck that serves exotic & worldly manna (such as freshly baked flat-breads, baguettes, tortillas, noodles, rice, wraps) infused with Vietnamese inspired cuisine. Our goal is to entertain your taste buds with the combination of the familiar local fares with exotic blends of heavenly cuisine from around the world.   To achieve these \"heavenly\" creations, each day we begin with fresh ingredients and made from scratch, adding spices and other delicacies from other parts the world, and introducing a splash of Vietnamese influence.  We purposefully rotate the menu selections on a weekly basis to give you an opportunity to try the different delectables that you might have been missing, not to mention keeping you from falling into the trap of \"food-burnout\".  Just one bite is all that's needed to entice you into indulging yourself in a tantalizing array of flavorful entrees, treats, and beverages.",
