  "description": "If you\u2019re living in Denver and your heart has been aching for those particularly spicy, saucy chicken wings that you can really only find on the east coast, get a Buffaload of this! ShaWING is bringing out all the Buffalo bar food and it\u2019s so authentic, it will get that broken heart bouncing again. Despite their love for the Mile High City, Chris & Jessica were tired of roughing it without the comfort of the Buffalo cuisine that they knew and loved. This was a problem worth fixin\u2019 and now Denver is in for a big win with this ShaWING Truck. It\u2019s as stunningly orange as the richly flavorful buffalo sauce that coats their juicy fried wings and chicken finger subs. No need to fly east for this fantastic food, just wing it with ShaWING!",
