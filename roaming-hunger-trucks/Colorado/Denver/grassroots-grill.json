  "description": "This friendly family-run truck is serving up sandwiches with an eclectic assortment of incredible flavors, all creatively crafted from Colorado ingredients. Ask anyone in Aurora and they\u2019ll rave that the amazing Green Chili Chicken Philly (warm Naan topped with cheesy chicken goodness, mild green chili paste, and red onion) is the real deal. And they can hardly wrap their minds around just how delicious the Strippin Chicken Wraps are; Marinated all-natural chicken breast served on homemade Naan, topped with shaved onions and creamy goat cheese yogurt sauce, and your choice of flavor: Ultimate Aioli, Jerk Vinaigrette, or Dijon Rouge Vinaigrette. There\u2019s much more on the menu too and of course, it\u2019s all adored. So the next time your stomach is grumbling, be sure to gradually gravitate over to Grassroots Grill to graze on this groundbreakingly great-tasting grub. ",
