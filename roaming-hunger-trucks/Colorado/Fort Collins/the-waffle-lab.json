  "description": "The Waffle Lab brings both sweet and savory Belgian Li\u00e8ge waffles to the residents for Fort Collins. What makes their waffle recipe unique is the use of yeast-leavened dough (instead of batter) which adds to the moistness of the waffle. If you're not in the mood for dessert, this truck offers plenty of savory options such as the \"Mild High\" grilled cheese and the Northwest Special (which tops the waffle with cream cheese and smoked salmon). Aside from waffles, they also serve Beer Brats. In addition, the truck makes sure to use organic and local ingredients as often as possible. ",
