  "description": "Since the dawn of fried foods, Americans have had a passion for corn dogs that is as rich and sweet as the cornmeal casing itself. The citizens of Fort Collins have taken that passion to rocky mountain heights now that Natalie Santelli and John Lawyer have converted their golden 1970\u2019s GMC Glenbrook RV into a bonafide Corn Dog Mobile.Corndoggies is wagging all over town, battering up a mouthwatering selection of homemade corn dogs and pairing them with scrumptiously innovative sauces. The spicy Jalapeno Chicken Gouda is served with Raspberry-Jalapeno jam sauce. Oh yeah, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s jam. The Chorizo is keepin\u2019 it cantina-style with its smoky chipotle sauce. Transcend to Breakfast Paradise with the waffle-wrapped Maple Bacon. And if you want to leave out the meat, you\u2019re in for a treat: there\u2019s a mouthwatering cajun-style Veggie Dog with your name on it. That\u2019s right; we\u2019re talking all wieners, no losers. If your Corndoggie needs a companion, you have a few tasty options.
