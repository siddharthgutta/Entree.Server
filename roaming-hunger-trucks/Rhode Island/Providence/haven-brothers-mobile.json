  "description": "One of the oldest mobile diners in the country, Haven Brothers can trace its origins back to a horse-drawn lunch wagon in the 1890s. The wagon has changed, but the fare remains, classic burgers, fries, and other diner dishes. If you're looking for a fancy eatery, this isn't it, but if you want a good meal at any time of day, Haven Brothers is the place to go.",
