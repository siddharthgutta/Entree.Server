  "description": "Best Damn Taco Truck AND Taco Shop!It started with an idea. \"Let's build a food truck that sells fresh, quality Mexican cuisine at an affordable price.\" We got big yellow truck, built are kitchen from scratch, and put together a creative menu with lots of great choices. In the end we realized that what we had wasn't just another run of the mill taco truck. It's \"The Best Damn Taco Truck in Town!\"Poco Loco uses the freshest ingredients, and everything on our menu is made from scratch daily by our experienced team of chefs. From our tender BBQ pulled pork to our chourizo and potato hash, we encourage our customers to try something new with every visit, and feel free to mix and match with any of our delicious salsas and beans.Come by and check us out for lunch or dinner, your stomach will thank you.
