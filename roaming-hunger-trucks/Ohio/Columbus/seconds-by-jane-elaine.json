  "description": "Seconds by Jane Elaine offers a throwback to childhood family meals in the form of the Sloppy Joe.Our homemade sandwiches are made with local, 100% grassfed bison from local farms-- a healthy alternative to traditional ground beef. Bison contains about half the calories and just a fraction of the fat of beef. Grassfed bison is rich in iron, vitamin B-12 and omega-3 fats. We also offer a completely vegetarian version made with soy protein, and none of our sloppie joes contain high fructose corn syrup (found in ready-made sloppy joe sauce.) We source local vendors and small businesses whenever possible because we love Ohio, Columbus, and the people who live here.",
