  "description": "I create and sell the Cleveland Polish Boy in Columbus,OH. I do this through a mobile food cart called Yellow Boy's Polish Boy's. So what is a polish boy? It's the best sandwich you could have never thought of. It consist of beef polish sausage topped with cole slaw, fries, and a homemade bbq sauce. I sell them for $5.00 all day and night. No i don't do hookup's, deals or anything else. I'm just putting it out there before you ask LOL!",
