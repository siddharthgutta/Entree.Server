  "description": "Launched in July of 2012, The Flat Top Pizza Company is a collaboration between Mike Miller (who has been at the helm of the illustrious Dan's Deli 41 since 2009) and Mike Cryan (who cooks good food and has a lot of time on his hands). By combining Mike M.'s arcane grilling techniques with Mike C.'s cache of carefully tempered recipes, an approach to pizza that seems quite unlike anything that has come before it was discovered.Fresh produce and locally made Ezzo meats, Sauteed and tossed with our handcrafted sauce on a flatbread crust and topped with seasoned mozzarella that has been cooked directly on our grill. These are our pizzas, and our goal is to feed them to as many people as we possibly can. We can be found on sidewalks or near offices and festivals by day and outside bars, breweries and private parties by night. Day or night, The Flat Top Pizza Company can usually be found somewhere in  or around Columbus- one Mike manning the grill, the other acting as ma\u00eetre d\u2019h\u00f4tel.",
