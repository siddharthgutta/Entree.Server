For the foodie in you choose form our globally loaded combinations like the Canadian which is our very own Poutine which is fresh cheese curds and beef gravy. How about our cabernet braised beef or the Bengali which is pulled curry chicken with pineapple cilantro and onion. It's here, it's now, it's the best!",
