  "description": "This father & son team has been hand-scooping delightfully creamy Italian ice since 2008 and all of the Midwest can agree that this perfectly sweet frozen treat is absolutely great. You can spruce up any special event with all your favorite flavors: Lemon, Cherry, Blue Raspberry, Rainbow, Tie-dye, Dreamsicle, Strawberry, and Mango. Cooling off has never tasted more nice, all thanks to Giuseppe\u2019s Italian Ice. ",
