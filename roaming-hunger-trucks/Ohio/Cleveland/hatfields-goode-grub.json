Their Pulled Pork Sandwiches and Quesadillas are positively pleasing, and the Bacon Mac & Cheese will keep you coming back. It\u2019s like their Uncle Tadpole\u2019s Catfish Stew was made just for you, and just wait till you take a peek at their whole menu!Take a pit stop at this truck and hit the spot with this GREAT Goode Grub.
