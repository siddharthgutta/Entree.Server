A mobile kitchen bringing peak quality, worthy, affordable fair is our adventure. Collecting our ingredients daily, preparing Fresh, from scratch is our passion. The truck was originally a Cleveland S.W.A.T Truck. When giving the opportunity to buy It, we jump all over it. That\u2019s when the ideas for Fired up Taco truck were born. We had a beast of a truck and a mission ahead of us, we started right away. After researching the market, we custom built the truck from ground up. Creating a full scale mobile kitchen on wheels, Complete with Coolers, fryer, 6 burner range stove, hoods, freezer, 3 compartment sink all brand new. Re creating the kitchens we\u2019ve trained in our whole careers was important to us.
