  "description": "Umami Moto won Cleveland\u2019s vote for the Best Food Truck and you\u2019ll understand why when you taste their wonderfully tasty Thai & Vietnamese fusion cuisine. As the name suggests, you\u2019re in for a world of savory flavor when you take a bite of any of their delicious Korean Burritos (including Korean beef with kimchi rice, carrot & daikon, and cilantro on a flour tortilla) Burgers (like their Thai Basil Turkey), and more. We also hear that their crunchy Sweet Potato Tater Tots (with creamy curry aioli) certainly hits the spot. Umami Moto is the way to go if you\u2019re in the mood for some of the most marvelous food you can find in Ohio. ",
