  "description": "The Green Machine is run by Casey and Steve, two keen Cleveland guys with a passion for making all of Ohio as green as can be, while serving up delicious and locally sourced organic cuisine. Steve, with his background in solar energy and urban farming, and Casey with his culinary experience, are together taking this groovy (and solar paneled!) Green Machine through town and serving up a menu that is exclusively pesticide, chemical, antibiotics & growth hormone-free, with ingredients straight from local family farms. Their offerings include tacos with juicy Jerk Chicken, savory Asian Pulled Pork, and scrumptious mixed Veggies, as well as an amazingly tasty selection of Sandwiches, Soups, and oh-so-delectable Desserts (like their classic Vanilla Bean Ice Cream on a Chocolate Chip Cookie). For a meal that\u2019s as good for the planet as it is for you and your community, come on out and eat at The Green Machine!",
