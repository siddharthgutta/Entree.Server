  "description": "Mason's Creamery is making Cleveland happier one scoop of handmade ice cream at a time!It takes a lot of work...The ice creams are all made in small batches of about 1 gallon each, which means less air whipped for a richer, creamier flavor. The chocolate ice cream? Chocolate is melted in house. Vanilla? Vanilla beans are scraped by hand. You get the picture. Oh, and, of course, a lot of taste testing, but hey, someone\u2019s gotta do it. Mason's Creamery never uses pre-made mixes, stabilizers, additives, dyes, or artificial anything, but believes in providing vegan options so that everyone can have a scoop \u2013 or two. Hope you enjoy the take on both the classics and the unique flavors offered!",
