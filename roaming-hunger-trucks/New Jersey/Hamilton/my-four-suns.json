  "description": "Kim Watson, owner/operator of My Four Suns, has a unique vision of Korean fusion cuisine that she's serving up to the streets of New Jersey. She says: \"The way that Korean cuisine is prepared, any patron could find something that they would be familiar with, and could enjoy, or possibly explore something new.\" Broaden your horizons with their delicious bacon & kimchi balls, or stick to the gold standard of Korean-infused street tacos. My Four Suns will surely brighten your day!",
