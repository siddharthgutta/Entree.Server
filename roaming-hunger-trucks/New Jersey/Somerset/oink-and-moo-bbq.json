Our meats are smoked low and slow over distinctive hickory, cherry and apple woods right on the truck in a Cookshack commercial-grade smoker.  We serve each meat in a unique style that complements its flavors and makes our food truck not only stand out among food trucks but also as a premier BBQ joint.",
