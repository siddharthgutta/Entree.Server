  "description": "The Taco Truck brings the beloved tradition of all-natural, simple Mexican street food to sustainable restaurants and mobile trucks. Eat More Tacos;)Inspired by their adventures in Mexico and California, co-founders Jason and Shachar Scott saw an opportunity to bring the culture surrounding authentic taquerias and food trucks to the East Coast. The foundation of the business was hiring the best team in the industry, beginning with Creative Director Gustavo Valladares and seasoned restaurant consultant Chris Viola. Chef Roberto Santiba\u00f1ez filled the crucial role of culinary partner and menu creator, and Chef Paris Retana was brought on as culinary director. As a critical foundation of TTT relies on being authentically Mexican, it only makes sense that the culinary leaders, Roberto and Paris, are both natives of Mexico City. They each bring their own heritage and knowledge to the kitchen, while harmoniously developing new flavors for the menu.",
