  "description": "The Rambler has been feeding ramblin\u2019 fans their fantastic fare since 2012. They\u2019re keeping the tradition alive as they continue to thrive, serving up a deliciously diverse selection of sandwiches, both unique and classic. Get your hands on their Bent Paddle Braised Short Rib Sandwich or their magnificent Muffaletta. Go hog wild on their Bacon Wrapped Slaw Dog or Teriyaki Pulled Pork Sandwich. Their loaded tots and Chicken Curry Tacos are also the talk of the town. We could ramble on and on about how amazing this food is, but you\u2019ll just have to taste for yourself and you too will see that The Rambler is a total win for the Twin Ports. ",
