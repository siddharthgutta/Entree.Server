  "description": "If you were to ask my family what my favorite food would be they would emphatically shout, \u201cHot Dogs\u201d.  And hold the ketchup.  Please.  No offense to those of you who love ketchup.  I hold no ill will towards ketchup.  But, when it comes to MY hot dogs, ketchup has no place in the same universe.  That\u2019s just how I roll.  You see, I developed this love for hot dogs from my dad and from a lifetime of trips to the MN State Fair where I can enjoy delicious footlong hot dogs.  And boy do I enjoy the footlongs.  Last year I consumed 8 footlongs in a single day.  I just love \u2018em that much.My hope is that you will love Natedogs that much.  Enough to enjoy 8 or more in a single day.  I can\u2019t wait to share with you my passion for hot dogs and I can\u2019t wait to make a bunch of new friends.  See ya soon!",
