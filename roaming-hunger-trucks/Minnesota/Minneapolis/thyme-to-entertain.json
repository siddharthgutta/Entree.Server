  "description": "Thyme to Entertain is a full service catering company that works with a diverse clientele to deliver events tailored to their individual tastes. One of the more unique culinary options we offer is wood fired pizzas prepared in a Mario Batali Chicago Wood Burning Brick Oven built into a 1968 fire truck. Our talented chefs create authentic wood-fired pies with a crisp chewy crust, deliciously charred edges, and a delicate smoky flavor that tantalizes and delights the taste buds. They top thin classic crusts with fine cheeses, original house made sauces, and fresh local produce wherever possible. Everything is made from scratch, from the fresh hand-pulled mozzarella to our chef\u2019s twelve hour roasted sweet tomatoes. Call us for your reception, fund raiser, or any outdoor party you dream. Our fire truck wood fired pizza party is an experience your guests will not quickly forget ",
