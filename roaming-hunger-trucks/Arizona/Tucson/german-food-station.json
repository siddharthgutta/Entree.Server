  "description": "German Food Station is your meeting point for an authentic German small meal in a nice neighborhood.Come over and have a snack.Max + Andrea Offermann from Germany welcome you at their German Food Station. On our first trip to the United States in September 1990 we have got married in Las Vegas.Since then, we fell in love with this country and its people and we always dreamed about living here. Now, 22 years later our dream came true. We found a new home far from home in beautiful Arizona and we are living here from October through May to escape from the cold and ugly German winter weather. Being restless Germans who can not just sit around and doing nothing at all, we decided to launch a small business by opening a German Food Trailer. After passing all the necessary requirements we are now ready to kick off and proudly present our typical German Fast Food. We are looking forward to see you at Picture Rocks Open Air Market and serve  our finger licking gastronomic specialities to you.",
