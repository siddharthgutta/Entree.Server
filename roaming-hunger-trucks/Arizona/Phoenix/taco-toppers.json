  "description": "15 years ago in the sand dunes of Southern California is where it all started. Ana Ortiz's passion was making and watching people enjoy her mexican food. This tradition was passed down to her daughter, Rose. In this spirit, the name Rosana's Kitchen was born. Offering delicious fresh salsas, to homemade tamales, delicious potato tacos to our creative spins on tradition, from our family to yours, we look forward to sharing with all.                                ~~Rose & Ana Ortiz~~",
