  "description": "Barraza Trade Company brews only the best for all the friendly Phoenicians, who of course love every delicious sip of this caffeine fix. With a passion for quality and sustainability, the Barraza family concocts their beverages (coffee, teas, refreshingly sweet authentic agua frescas) with ingredients imported directly from small-plot farms. The Barrazas have also formed beautiful relationships with local farmers markets & co-ops where they procure ingredients for their seasonal menu (that includes sandwiches, cheesecake, and more), and in turn, donate their material waste to make mulch.For a culinary experience that\u2019s completely wholesome and scrumptious, you must come by and visit the Barraza Trade Company.
