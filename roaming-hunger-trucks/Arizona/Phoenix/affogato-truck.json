  "description": "Go big or go home is the only way to describe it! The Affogato Truck is the biggest espresso coffee truck in the west coast, and perhaps even the world. Standing over 25,000 lbs, 25ft long, 13 ft tall, 400 sq.ft of shade, you know forgetting to put on your suncream in Arizona won't be such a big issue. However, even if that's not enough to keep you cool in the hot desert of Arizona, The Affogato Truck, along with the best soft-serve ice cream and specialized espresso drinks in the country, also comes with a misting system. So when all is said and done, when it comes to keeping you cool, there is nothing more cool than the Affogato Truck. ",
