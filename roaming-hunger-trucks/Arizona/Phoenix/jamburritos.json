  "description": "Our signature sandwich, the Jamburrito, was born out of our fascination with the burrito.  It seemed to lend itself to quick service.  So, we began experimenting with Cajun burritos\u2014a tortilla wrapped around all your New Orleans delicacies, like Andouille sausage, shrimp, chicken, rice, peas, Creole and Etouffee sauce. We named this sandwich \u201cJamburrito\u201d - jambalaya wrapped up like a burrito. This led to the name of the company: Jamburritos \u201cCajun Grille\u201d.  Next, we created the K-Taco, mouth watering Cajun Beef Tacos and Creole Chicken Tacos \u2013 served with black bean and corn salsa, topped with Creole slaw and diced tomatoes.Our dishes are often described as \u2018comfort food\u2019 \u2013 food that looks good, smells good, tastes good, and makes you feel good.  Our commitment to quality food and friendly service has won us critical acclaim and more importantly customer satisfaction throughout Phoenix.",
