  "description": "We are hitting the streets and serving the tastiest custom coffee and espresso drinks from \u201cfrothy\u201d our 1957 (bread) delivery van. We will be stepping back in time and serving coffee drinks the way they used to be, before the sugary drink explosion happened. Remember when coffee smelled like coffee? Sugar came in a cube? and milk was poured from a glass bottle?   Take a coffee break, and book us for your next event, or find us curbside. PS. We can also pressurize, tap and pour beer for any event.",
