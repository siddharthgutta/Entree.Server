  "description": "Out in Calgary, Canada, a crew of cousins began serving fresh-squeezed lemonade and quickly accrued awards for their refreshing concoctions made exclusively with fresh ingredients. Now a few more of these cousins are cooling off Phoenix with their now-famous selection of lemonades infused with all sorts of yummy fruits (oranges, raspberries, lime, etc..) and herbs (thyme, ginger, rosemary, mint, and more). Folks sure love Family Squeezed Lemonade for providing the most delicious way to refresh their day.",
