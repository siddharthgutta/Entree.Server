  "description": "These gourmet Liege waffles are not your mamas waffles (unless your mama grew up in Belgium)! Waffle Crush make their Liege waffle dough fresh with imported pearl sugar. When the waffles are cooked in the irons the large pearl sugar pieces caramelize, producing a slightly crispy, caramelized exterior but leave the center soft, chewy, and warm! They can be topped with anything from powdered sugar to Nutella, Biscoff, fresh fruit, homemade cream, stuffed with chocolate or topped with ice cream! No syrup needed! This truck is a delicious place to eat, and a fun one, too! Don't miss it!",
