  "description": "A transplant from New Jersey I now live in Sedona Arizona and I could not find a real east coast cheesesteak,  meatball parm or Italian Sausage and pepper sandwich for the life of me..So  being a professional chef I thought I would enlighten the Sedona area with the great food of the Jersey SHore. I also make killer Gyro's and Mac and cheese to die for notto mention  the best ceasar  \"truck Made\" Salad you will ever have.",
