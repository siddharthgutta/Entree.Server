With twists on popular favorites like the bahn-mi, or a frank topped with chipotle lobster mac n cheese, there's a frank for everyone. Frank. also offers hand cut potato and sweet potato chips, deep fried \"truck made\" pickles, and a rotating gelato flavor from grateful spoon.This great truck was started by Philly transplant Adam, who was tickled by the idea of being able to top a hot dog with just about anything. This shows up quite readily in his work, as he offers dogs topped with everything from aioli to funyuns.
