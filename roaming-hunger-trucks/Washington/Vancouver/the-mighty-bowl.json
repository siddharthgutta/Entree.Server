  "description": "Mighty Bowl is pioneering the food cart movement in Vancouver, WA. Their mission is to serve healthy, tasty, and local food to the masses.   Might Bowl's bean & rice bowls can be customized with a number of different toppings and sauces.  Sauces are made from scratch on the truck, all from whole food ingredients. They make three sauces: a Lemon Curry (Mighty), Spicy Chipotle (Kiggins) and a Peanut (Sweet, not spicy). Try any of their bowls as a Might Wrap, and finish off your meal with a Real Fruit Smoothie.",
