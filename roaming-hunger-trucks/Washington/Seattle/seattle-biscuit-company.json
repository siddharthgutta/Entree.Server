  "description": "Seattle Biscuit Company is a fantastic biscuit truck on the streets of Seattle. Using only local Washington-Oregon ingredients, they're building biscuits without boundaries. Offering older flavor combos, like jalape\u00f1o blackberry jelly and bacon, and new ideas to satisfy the fusion-friendly west coast, like ham, bacon, Beechers cheese, sweet onion mustard, pickles, and apple butter, this fare has something to offer everyone. Find it on the streets and grab yourself a bite!",
