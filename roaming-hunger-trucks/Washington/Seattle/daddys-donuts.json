  "description": "It\u2019s a pretty decent day when you can delightfully dig into some Daddy\u2019s Donuts. These mini donuts pack mighty flavor as they\u2019re cooked to order and topped with treats. You can enjoy them plain or try any of Daddy\u2019s crazy combo concoctions, like the Straw-Bella: plain mini\u2019s with a drizzle of fresh strawberry & white chocolate syrup, topped with whip cream and sprinkles, or the Funky Monkey with milk chocolate & peanut butter drizzle topped with fresh bananas, or the Tayo Tornado: mini\u2019s topped with maple glaze and fresh bacon, just to name a few. Daddy\u2019s has a storefront in Kenmore but they also have a trailer and can deliver these dazzling donuts straight to your event. Voted 5th best donuts in Western Washington, you just know that you gotta go with Daddy\u2019s Donuts.  ",
