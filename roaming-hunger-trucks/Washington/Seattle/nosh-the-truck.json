  "description": "Nosh The Truck is a fantastic truck on the streets of Seattle serving up all sorts of new and unusual food. Everything this truck does is \"all about the food\" - from hand pulled-mozzarella to hand-rolled all-butter pastry for the pies. All of the meat is also personally ground by these chefs, so they know exactly what's going in to your deliciousness. There is a little of something for everybody here, and the rabbit, bone marrow, or simple fish and chips is sure to please and impress.",
