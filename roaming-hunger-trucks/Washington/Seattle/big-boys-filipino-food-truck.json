The first layer is 2 fried eggs with shredded cheese in between, the 2nd layer is your choice of meat (short rib steak, spam, langonisa patty, hotlinks), and the third layer is a deep fried hash brown topped off with a tomato based secret sauce. Big Boy\u2019s Filipino food Truck was started by Nate Daep and Melanie Querubin in September 2012. Their mission is to serve and bring people together using their sense of Filipino cuisine in a unique and flavorful way. Not only will your stomach be satisfied but we assure you that every bite will enable an experience from every island of the Philippines. ",
