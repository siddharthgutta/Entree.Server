  "description": "One of the staples of the Levantine cultures is hospitality. Welcoming friends, family and even strangers into your home is a way of life that has created over the centuries a very rich and variable cuisine. In this spirit, Falafel Salam welcomes anyone and everyone to its truck.The falafel is always freshly made; crispy on the outside, steaming hot and soft on the inside. 10 minute old falafel is tossed.The shawarma is made using sustainable, local, organic chicken meat marinated in a rich spice blend overnight (with olive oil and garlic, YUM!).Just try to leave unsatisfied.",
