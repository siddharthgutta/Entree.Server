  "description": "Our food, as much as our style, is bold and intentional. The focus is on quality.Everything is hand-made right down to the mayonnaise. We put our heart and soul into everything that we do - from order to pick up, you will feel the love.When you come to our truck we want you to experience a little bit of New Orleans. This means you can take time to relax and breathe and enjoy what we have created.  We want you to feel special and appreciated.  We want you to have nostalgic bites that take you back to experiences in childhood. We want our soul food to touch your soul.Every menu item carries a fond childhood memory for me. I am sharing the best, most comforting, most delicious street foods New Orleans has to offer. Every item carries with it the history and flavor of my home town. I chose each menu item then ran it by my family, even my granny. When granny approves, you know it\u2019s got to be good!",
