  "description": "Mike Montanti is solving the crisis of Seattle\u2019s lack of decent East Coast sandwiches with his deli on wheels. He\u2019s serving breakfast sandwiches (with egg, cheese, and meat, of course), deli sandwiches (both hot and cold) with 6in Kaiser Rolls, or Marble Rye, or 12in Subs, as well as just meat and cheese rolls (for the gluten intolerant folks), Sabrett hot dogs (imported from the far reaches of the Eastern United States), a humble iceberg salad or veggie sandwich (even though this is not exactly a vegetarian lovers\u2019 type of rig), and a rotation of delicious treats, including coffee (just 1 type, regular), cookies, pastries, and pickles (biguns!). For an actual sandwich that\u2019s made to order and sliced right in front of you, Delicatessen MONTANTi is exactly what you want. ",
