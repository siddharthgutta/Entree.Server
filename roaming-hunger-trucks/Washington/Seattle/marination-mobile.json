  "description": "Marination\u2019s grub melts Korean heat and aloha love together in corn tortillas, and also in your mouth.Once upon a time Kamala and Roz sent their very hard-earned money to Wall Street to grow. Turns out Wall Street wasn\u2019t raised well by its parents, and the once-healthy bundle they sent eastward limped back home, barely escaping with any life left in it at all. A broken sliver of its former self, they considered the anemic remains they were dealing with, wondering how on Earth to prop it back up and get it going again?All the thinking and no play made Kamala and Roz hungry. So Kamala marinated some stuff. Then she called a shoulder to lean on and, talking with her mouth full, admitted things like \u201cI work so hard, I can\u2019t start from scratch again, there\u2019s got to be a way to stop this train before it totally derails. Wow these spicy pork tacos are the best I\u2019ve made in weeks.\u201dThe shoulder, being a chef friend named Catherine, replied \u201cYour marinades are exquisite, bordering on ambrosial. I\u2019ve tried to replicate them many times. Hey, I know, you can build a marinated meat stand on wheels. Ha ha ha.\u201dKamala\u2019s eyes grew as big as a kimchi rice bowl and Roz\u2019s brain spun like a chrome hubcap. Marination, The Saucy Food Truck, was born.",
