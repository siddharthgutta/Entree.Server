  "description": "Forget what you think you know about waffles, My Sweet Lil Cakes has taken everyone's favorite breakfast food, and reinvented it in the best way possible. These fluffy creations are especially easy to eat standing up, as they come on a stick. If you're hankering for something sweet, try the red velvet with dark cherries and sweet cream cheese, yum! Or for those missing a sweet-tooth, they've got a beer and hickory smoked bacon flavor that will blow your mind. ",
