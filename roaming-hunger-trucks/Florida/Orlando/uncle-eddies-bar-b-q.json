  "description": "Uncle Eddie is roaming all over Florida and serving up some succulent Memphis-style BBQ. You just may find this slow-smoked selection of juicy, tender brisket, ribs, pork, and chicken to be the best you\u2019ve ever tasted. Mmm...and nothing else can quite complete your meal like baked beans, coleslaw, mac & cheese, or collard greens. For fantastic flavors and service that makes you feel like family, head on over to Uncle Eddie\u2019s BBQ!",
