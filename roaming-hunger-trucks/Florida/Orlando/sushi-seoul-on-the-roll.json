Yeah Yeah Yeah, we know . . . there is no way you are going to eat fish from a truck. . . . but you do know that they put a man on the moon 42 years ago? Run by two veterans of the restaurant business (one a sushi master), look for us at all the food truck meet-ups and at some of the better locally-owned bars in town.Follow us as we pop up all over the Central Florida Region! Thanks,Mike Smith and Al Ruiz",
