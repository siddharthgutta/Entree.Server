  "description": "Off The Griddle was created from the mind of a local Chef/ Farmer Micheal Musoke, a passionate cook with Aquaorganic background. His knowledge of cultivating aquatic animals and plants lead him to sell his organic produce in Gainesville, but something in his life was missing. He wanted to cook and share great food made with great ingredients, that's when it was decided to create a mobile kitchen. The idea of making great meals and fresh squeeze juices with the finest ingredients for everybody to enjoy puts them Off The Grid!",
