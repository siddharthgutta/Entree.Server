  "description": "Dochos Concession is a family owned food truck serving the streets of Tampa. They love to create new foods. Our niche is Pressed sandwiches and fried delights and at times may combine the 2, such as our Monte Castro. The Monte Castro combines a Cuban and a Monte Christo by taking a pressed cuban sandwich battered in a sweet/spicey batter then deep fried with your option of hot sauce drizzeled on top. Other deep fired menu items include pickles, oreos, s'mores, and weekly specials.",
