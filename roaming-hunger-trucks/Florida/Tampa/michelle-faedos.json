  "description": "My husband Robert and I started our business back in 2003. With much work and struggle, we have been recognized by many local and national news editorials. Those speak for themselves. We are known for our gourmet deviled crabs and out of this world cuban sandwiches. We look forward to bringing the best food on-the-go, ever. GUARANTEED. My family and I thank all of our current and future customers and hope that they all follow us for years to come. Thank you :)",
