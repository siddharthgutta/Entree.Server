  "description": "Maggie has been on the Move, in her food truck, since 2011 and offers a fresh and healthy Mediterranean fusion cuisine. No stranger to the food industry, starting in restaurants at the tender age of 16, Maggie brings over 30 years of food experience to the food truck. Before opening the Food Truck in December 2011, Maggie was a regular on the Farmer's Market circuit in the Tampa Bay area, most notably the Saturday Morning Market in Downtown St. Pete. Many of the dishes Maggie serves are her own creation, adding her own twist to Greek, Moroccan and Spanish dishes. Fresh, delicious food isn't Maggie's only concern. Customer service and making you feel welcome is always a part of the Maggie on the Move experience. You may walk up to the window as a stranger... but you will to walk away a new friend. ",
