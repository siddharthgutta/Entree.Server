  "description": "This truck is what happens when a Korean-American goes to a traditional French culinary school and then applies those techniques to her traditional Korean cuisine. Some fusion, some traditional, all tasty and well executed. Mmm BAP is breaking down the barriers between the American people and Korean cuisine. As an extra bonus for celiacs and anyone else with a gluten free diet, all food is served from a  non-contaminated gluten free kitchen.",
