  "description": "The Kaixo crew procured the finest culinary education back in Basque Country- the beautiful pocket of land right between Northern Spain and Southern France. Now they\u2019re here in Tampa, treating local foodies to their elegant selection of gourmet pintxos (tapas). A few of their delicious creations include homemade paella, crispy shrimp with creamy coconut sauce, prosciutto croqueta, chistorra bocadillo (a traditionally simple yet succulent sandwich with brightly seasoned sausage), and more. You\u2019ll also find delectable desserts such as Tiramisu and Creme Brulee too. Come out to Kaixo (or have them come cater your next event) and bask in this fantastic selection of sophisticated street cuisine. ",
