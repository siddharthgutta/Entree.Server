  "description": "Miami is home to some of the greatest Latin American cuisine in the world and RickRey\u2019s Peruvian Fusion, although small, is dishing out big portions with such big flavors there\u2019s no doubt that they\u2019re a mighty contribution to the sweet heat of The Magic City. You can find RickRey\u2019s cruising the beaches and serving authentic recipes straight from \u2018From Our Wok to Your Plate.' Check out their delicious Lomo Saltado (strips of sirloin steak) and Chicken Saltado (strips of chicken breast) that are stir fried and flamed with the use of a wok by combining Peruvian spices, thinly sliced tomatoes and purple onions, and chopped cilantro, and are served on a bed of white rice and fries, or as a sandwich if you\u2019re munching on the go. If you\u2019re craving flavor and freshness, then this incredible food from Peru is the the right choice for you!",
