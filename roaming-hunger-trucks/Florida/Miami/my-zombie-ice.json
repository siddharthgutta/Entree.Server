  "description": "Delicious shaved ice treats with a zombie twist. Look for us on the streets of South Florida as well as public and private events! Zeeeee you out there!Is a Zombie Ice a snow cone?No, a snow cone is made from crushed ice. Zombie Ice is made with shaved ice.Shaving produces a very fine ice that appears snow-like. This extremely fine texture causes syrups added to it to be absorbed by the ice, so the flavors are in the ice and not at the bottom of the cup.Our flavors are Gluten Free & Kosher Certified",
