First, the wrapper with its custom-printed inked label...is all edible. Second, the crunchy cookies for you to choose, come in classic flavors (Chocolate Chip, Oatmeal Raisin, Snickerdoodle, etc\u2026), but a few options are quite distinct (Confetti Whoopie Pie, Fruity Pebbles & Marshmallow, Maple Flapjack, Snickerdoodle Candy Corn, etc\u2026). You\u2019ll also find an eclectic selection of ice cream flavors; like Strawberry, Chocolate Peppermint, and L\u2019Eggo My Eggo, Horchata, Thai Tea, and Pizza, Fried Chicken & Waffles, Peking Duck\u2026 and all their flavors are so crazy-tasty.So come on out to the Coolhaus truck and dig right into one of these delightful creations, with flavors as lovely as home, sweet, home.
