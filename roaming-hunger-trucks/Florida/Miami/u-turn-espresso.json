  "description": "U-Turn Espresso was conceived one year ago out of a love for good coffee and a spared thought for espresso drinkers whose busy work schedules don\u2019t allow them to leave the office to satisfy their cravings. We have been there, done that in corporate America and the staff room drip coffee just doesn\u2019t cut the mustard!And even if you can get away from the office, how hard is it to find a really great cup of coffee?While traveling abroad for many years we experienced a coffee culture where Espresso is a work of art and the Barista is an artist. We feel it is an art form that has been lost in many corporate coffee houses across America.At U-Turn Espresso our mission is to address these issues by making an exceptional cup of coffee and delivering it to your doorstep.We are a \"cafe on wheels.\" Let us deliver coffee to your workplace or at your next event!",
