  "description": "We put a new spin on the classic treat, the popsicle.  Our pops are made in small batches & handcrafted  to ensure the best flavors.  They are made from the best local fruits & herbs that we can get our hands on & of course with all natural ingredients.  We also sweeten only with organic evaporated cane sugar.  These yummy goodies are also gluten free & vegan friendly.  Backyard Pops are NOT...all things artificial (colors, flavors, etc.), no GMOs, high fructose corn syrup or refined sugars, not mass produced and definitely not boring!!!",
