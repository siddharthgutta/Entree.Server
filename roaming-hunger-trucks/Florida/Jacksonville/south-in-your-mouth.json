  "description": "NOT JUST GOOD, BUT GREAT THE BEGINNING...We started humbly but with a grand plan: To create the finest Southern eats Jacksonville has ever tasted, end of story. And with nothing but a grill, a food truck and this dream, we've grown and exploded to this point where you're reading this right now and hopefully salivating!Our secret? It's not one, admittedly. The best ingredients is a big part. An unrelenting love for food is the other big part. Between those two, we think we pretty much have our bases covered.Turns out we also like people, though. We're not making these delicious, one-of-a-kind creations to not share them with our human species brethren. We hope to share them with you, soon. So head on in to the nearest South in your Mouth location and feast your eyes on the greatest Southern food truck food ever made. You won't be sorry you did.",
