  "description": "Local Alohans are legitimately loving every bite of Up N Smoke BBQ Pit\u2019s savory selection. This extraordinary truck pulled up and started serving amazing BBQ back in 2014. With a tasty variety of slow-smoked meats slathered in homemade rubs and sauces, as well as an exciting rotation of enticing daily specials, their scrumptious fare became a real fast favorite. Juicy pulled pork, fresh hot Sonoran dogs, robustly flavorful beef brisket, fall-off-the-bone ribs, and crisp broccoli slaw are just a few of the dishes you\u2019ll find at Up \u2018N Smoke BBQ Pit. You better come out and eat soon so that you too can enjoy this deliciousness!",
