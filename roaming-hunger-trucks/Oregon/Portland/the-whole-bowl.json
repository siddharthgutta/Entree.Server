  "description": "The Whole Bowl is a comforting and healthy medley of brown rice, red and black beans, fresh avocado, salsa, black olives, sour cream, Tillamook cheddar, cilantro, Tali Sauce and trace amounts of attitude.  Tali Sauce is The Whole Bowl's secret weapon.  Referred to by many as \"crack sauce\", this lemony-garlicky blend has been building local addictions in the Pearl,  Downtown and now at the new Hawthorne location, for over 8 years.  Sauce devotees have been known to experience a prolonged sense of well-being and tremendous relaxation upon consumption.A Big Bowl is 5.50 and Bambino is 5.00.  Chips and drinks are 1.00.",
