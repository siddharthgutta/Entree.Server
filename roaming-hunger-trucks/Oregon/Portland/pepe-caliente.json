  "description": "After 16 years of cooking for the corporate world, Chef Jose is now cruising his very own cool grey truck through town and treating all the peeps of Portland to  amazingly flavorful Veracruz cuisine. Pepe Caliente is the roaming home to some incredible food, like Jose\u2019s famous Jarocho Plate: cochinita pibil (pork that\u2019s been slowly roasted in banana leaves) rolled in crispy corn tortillas, doused in a savory broth, and garnished with jicama sticks, pickled red onions, and habaneros, and served alongside tasty rice and beans. The tacos, burritos, and bowls are all just as delicious, so the next time you\u2019re ready to eat, come visit Pepe Caliente for a feast that\u2019s \u201cAuthentic. Fresh. Addictive.\u201d!",
