  "description": "Owned by a former resident of Louisiana, you can be sure that A Cajun Life is as authentic as it can get outside of the South. They aim to keep their menu and food simple and it makes for some absolutely tasty cajun dishes. Try their gumbo, loaded with chicken and sausage, or if you're in the mood for seafood, anything with crawfish is delicious! ",
