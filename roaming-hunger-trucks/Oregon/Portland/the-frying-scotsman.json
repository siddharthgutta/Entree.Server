  "description": "The Frying Scotsman Fish and Chips authentic British style fish and chips.Many people remark about the taste of fish and chips being different in the UK, and there\u2019s a reason for that. Ever since the first chip shop, or \u201cchippy\u201d opened in 1860 in London, the British have led the way with light batter, breading and delicate cuts of cod, red snapper, halibut, mahi mahi and haddock.The recipes we use at The Frying Scotsman have been handed down a generation or two in Scotland.",
