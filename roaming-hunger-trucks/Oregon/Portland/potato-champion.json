  "description": "Potato Champion is Portland's only late night fry cart!Our fries are prepared in the authentic Belgian style, meaning that after they are peeled, cut, and washed, they are first blanched at a low temperature in the fryer. This cooks the potato without crisping it and brings out the potatoes natural fragrance. The fries are then left to sweat out the oil and are fried to order at a much higher temperature to crisp the outside of the fry while the inside remains soft and fluffy. We are also serving Poutine! The classic Canadian comfort food consisting of fries covered in cheese curds and gravy. Our gravy is made from a free range chicken stock and the curds are provided by the award winning Rogue Creamery in Central Point, OR.",
