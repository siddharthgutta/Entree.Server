  "description": "The Curb Truck is keeping it fresh, hot, and cool in Honolulu with specialty coffee and shave ice. Quality products, great service, and some quirkiness.Depending on location and event we have full espresso bar (The Curb is a drink truck) right now the big generator decided to take a sabbatical. Come visit and you can try the amazing ice coffee or lychee bomb. You will also find that Sumner (Sumo) can't talk and do anything at the same time, it is really sad.",
