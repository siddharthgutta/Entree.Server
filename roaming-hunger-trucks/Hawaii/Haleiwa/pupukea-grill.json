  "description": "Pupukea Grill Lunch Wagon was established in 2008 and is located on the North Shore of Oahu.  It has fast become a favorite spot of regular pro surfers, locals, and visitors.  Farm fresh island produce and local fish help to inspire a seasonal menu that caters to both locals and visitors alike. Pupukea Grill is not your usual lunch wagon.  Although plate lunches are served, the rest of the menu consists of non-traditional lunch wagon fare such as panini, freshly made quesadilla, fish taco, signature fish bowls and shaved ice. The most popular item is our fish bowl which is served with freshly made pico de gallo, sour cream, and lime over brown rice.  Combining \"Okazu\", Japanese, Mexican and local style cooking techniques and ingredients have allowed us to create our own little niche on the North Shore.",
