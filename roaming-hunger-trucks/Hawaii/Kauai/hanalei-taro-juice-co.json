  "description": "Hanalei Taro & Juice Co. (HTJC) was founded in 2000 as a value-added venture of the 6 generation family farm, W.T. Haraguchi Farm. HTJC provides unique family recipes that customers, as well as tour guests, can enjoy. Being a farming family, our daily lifestyle embodies the \"Farm to Table\" concept. Our Grandparents and Great-Grandparents tell stories of how they ate whatever crop was in season, and the same holds true with our lunch wagons now. Our menu is constantly changing with the seasons so there's always something new, fresh and delicious for you to come and try!",
