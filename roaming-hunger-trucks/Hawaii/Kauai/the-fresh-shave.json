They started out with the dream of offering a healthier version of one of Hawaii\u2019s well known treats, shave ice, to be able to better suit the needs of their children and the children around. Being able to offer this treat without high fructose corn syrup, preservatives, dyes, and artificial sweeteners is a mission they have finally fulfilled, and you can really taste the difference! Stop by today to try one of these great, all-natural treats. You won't regret it!",
