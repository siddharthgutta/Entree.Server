  "description": "City: Pittsburgh, PAThe Piergoi Truck has been traveling around the streets of Pittsburgh, giving locals a taste of this authentic Polish delight. These stuffed dumplings, most often filled with either potatoes, meats, cheeses, or fruits, make the perfect bite-sized meal. Still hungry? Fill up with a number of their Combination platters. Pair a Pierogi with some Haluski (a traditional Polish noodle and cabbage dish) for a tasty meal. ",
