  "description": "Ka\u2019Chi Truck serves up street food to West Chester/Southeast PA area.  We don\u2019t pretend or try to be a fancy pants gourmet food establishment, nor are we your typical quick service food joint. We make and serve good food with a unique twist. Being Korean, I wanted to infuse the flavors that I grew up on and create something more interesting to eat. We incorporate all the authentic Korean flavors that you would expect but with a distinct modern flare made fresh every day from family recipes. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that everything is at street-fare prices.",
