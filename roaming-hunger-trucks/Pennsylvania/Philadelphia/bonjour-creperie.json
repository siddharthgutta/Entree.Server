  "description": "2014 Vendy Award Winner! You may not be scaling the Eiffel Tower anytime soon but that doesn't mean your taste buds can't pack their bags and head to Paris for a delicious sweet or savory crepe! At Philly's Bonjour Creperie, customers can get their crepes stuffed with gruyere and bacon, smoked salmon and cream cheese, goat cheese and caramelized onions, and much more! Those craving a sweet treat can have theirs filled with sugar and cinnamon, strawberries and nutella, and baked apples drizzled with caramel just to name a few. Their crepes are typically made with flour imported from France, yet they can also be made with gluten free buckwheat! ",
