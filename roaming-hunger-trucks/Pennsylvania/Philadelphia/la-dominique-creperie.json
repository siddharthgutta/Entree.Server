  "description": "La Dominique is well-known for serving the best crepes you're likely to ever taste, and there's not much of a secret as to why: the quality and the care. The cart's owner, Zbigniew, makes sure to procure the best ingredients - fresh, wholesome, and, in the case of the chicken, hormone-free - and creates each crepe with love. As he says, he would never want to serve a crepe to a customer that he wouldn't serve to his family.Check out some of the delicious sweet options, with the Tiramisu, the Viennese, and the classic Banana Strawberry, and try a savory Mexican, Italian, or Smoked Salmon crepe, or one of the  many other choices. Whatever you order, you're sure to walk away satisfied.",
