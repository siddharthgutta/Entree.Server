  "description": "Bringing the beach to you...curbside! We specialize in tasty lobster rolls, shrimp rolls, surf and turf, fish tacos, salmon sliders and more!Our menu takes the Chinese philosophical concept of yin-yang and applies it to every item we offer.Yin-yang is used to describe how opposite or contrary forces are interconnected and give rise to each other as they interrelate to one another. These dualities exist everywhere: hot and cold; dark and light; male and female, etc.Well, we do that with our food - surf and turf, lobster and beef, warm and hit, sweet and sour, soft and crunchy.",
