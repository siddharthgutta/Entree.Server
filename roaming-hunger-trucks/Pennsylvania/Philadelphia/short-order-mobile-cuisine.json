Now this team of three is driving their ultra neat Miami-blue truck through the streets, cooking with quality local ingredients, and dishing out everything from saucy Sloppy Joes to yummy Chicken Tacos. So be sure to eat at Short Order Mobile Cuisine for an incredibly tasty treat with the perfect touch of heat, and served at Short Order speed. ",
