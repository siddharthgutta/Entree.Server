Since 1956, Mister Softee trucks have been roaming the nation, twisting up and serving out delicious soft serve ice cream cones. Today there are over 600 trucks towing around tasty treats, including in Reading, where folks have a special connection to Mister Softee since they\u2019re close neighbors with Philadelphia, its town of origin.
