Their cuisine is a unique blend of Middle Eastern food, like taameya (Egyptian felafel), shawarma, hummus, with the many cultures and spices of Europe, the Mediterranean, and Africa. Many of these authentic Egyptian dishes are naturally vegetarian and gluten free but, there are beef and chicken options as well. In addition to many of the options being vegetarian and gluten free, all of their items are preservative free as well!",
