  "description": "City: Waynesburg, PAAt Moore's Hot Dogs customers go crazy for their classic dog topped with chopped onions, mustard, and moore's chili sauce. If you're feeling a little more daring try their southern dog (topped with bbq sauce and french fried onions), or the tex-mex dog (slathered in shredded cheddar cheese and jalapeno peppers). Make sure to check their menu for daily specials as well!  ",
