  "description": "Smart. Handmade. Cuisine. NEPA'S only gourmet food truck!Sometimes you\u2019re just hungry for fresh, hand built food made with smart ingredients. You want memorable cuisine, you want great food but you don\u2019t want to follow a dress code. And you're right, putting on your big boy pants for a meal does not create the great dining experience. Who says upscale has gotta be so uppity? Its not a crime that your palate has EVOLVED beyond that of the \u201ctraditional\u201d and \u201cclassical\u201d eye-talian joint. Now what? At WTF, we love a good meatball as much as the next guy but we think the people need some options. So let's change this up and throw your taste buds a bit of a party. Call it what you want... New American, Street food, or Bistro fare. We\u2019re just here to serve up some of the tastiest and unconventional food you\u2019ve ever ordered... from a big green truck. Just don\u2019t ask for silverware (they\u2019re plastic sporks) because we eat with our HANDS! No need to fret, we've got LOTS of napkins.",
