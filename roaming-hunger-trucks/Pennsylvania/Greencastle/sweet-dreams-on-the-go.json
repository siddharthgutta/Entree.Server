  "description": "Sweet Dreams On The Go is taking Southern-style Surf & Turf cuisine through the streets of Greencastle. For a quintessential Nashville experience complete with country-western music experience and Patsy Cline-inspired cuisine, you must come try the tasty grub from this truck. The smoked beef brisket sandwich is perfectly tender, the Maryland crab cakes are fluffy and flavorful, and the shrimp skewers are plump and perfectly marinated in savory sauces...now this is the kind of deliciousness that sweet dreams (as well as Patsy Cline love songs) are made of.
