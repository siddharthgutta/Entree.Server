  "description": "The Mobile Marlay food truck serves Marlay House Pub fish and chips around Atlanta.In Ireland the \u201cFish & Chips Van\u201d is a staple of many a town center, sporting event and usually found near the lively pubs at closing time. Many will agree that there\u2019s not much better than a good feed of fantastic Guinness battered fresh Cod and hand cut perfectly fried Chips after a few pints! We figured that getting The Marlay House \u201cmobile\u201d and sharing our dedication to great Fish & Chips outside the City of Decatur was a great way forward. It just so happens that this has coincided with the incredible energy surrounding the whole \u201cStreet Food\u201d movement in and around Atlanta.The Mobile Marlay offers a concise menu to include our Guinness Braised Brisket and of course Fish & Chips. You can find us at the growing number of street food events in Midtown and Downtown, or just bring us to your next event!",
