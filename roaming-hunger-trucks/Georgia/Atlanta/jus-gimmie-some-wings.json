  "description": "Jus\u2019 Gimmie Some Wings is bringing the best Buffalo creations throughout all of Atlanta. Before the wings are served to you fresh and hot, Chef Kevin puts them through the most delicious process; marinating the wings for 24 hours, then letting them soak up additional seasonings for another 24 hours, before being dipped in the fryer- no breading needed when you\u2019ve already got so much flavor. Then you choose which of the 15 made-from-scratch sauces you\u2019d like, including Honey Lemon Pepper, Cajun Hot Ranch, Classic Buffalo, and so much more. Next time you\u2019re hungry for something amazing, jus\u2019 head to this truck and get yourself these wings!",
