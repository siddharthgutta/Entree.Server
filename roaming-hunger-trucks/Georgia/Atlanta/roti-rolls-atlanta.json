  "description": "All right, Atlanta. There is a new rule of the road: keep an eye out for Roti Rolls, because after ruling as the \u201cBest Food Truck\u201d in Charleston, SC for five years in a row, they\u2019re rolling out a brand new truck, just for you. Roti Paratha (AKA a \u201cPillowy Pocket of Love\u201d) is a warm, doughy, flaky bread that is used to tuck all sorts of toppings into a tasty taco. With a mission to exclusively use locally sourced \u201cfarm to truck\u201d ingredients, the fusion-full Roti selection at this truck is all fresh and fantastically flavorful. You just gotta come out and rock a Roti Roll. ",
