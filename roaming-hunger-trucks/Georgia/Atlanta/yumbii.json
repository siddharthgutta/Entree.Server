  "description": "Tacos roll to a new level!  So what happens when you fuse together the best in Asian-Mexican flavors and Southern cooking traditions?  Yumbii: Far Out Food\u2026the first and finest gourmet restaurant on wheels to roll out on the streets of Atlanta.  The result is long lines for the best damn meal you\u2019ve had off a food truck east of the Mississippi, and the food is created by a world class chef, Tomas Lee of Hankook Taqueria in Westside. The Yumbii name is a fusion in itself: \u201cYum\u201d for outrageously good food, and \u201cbii\u201d for social media interaction (like the wii games).  The truck is high energy, inviting, and digital to the core. Famed Chef Lee isn\u2019t afraid to create cuisine as Yumbii rolls \u2013 you can be sure we\u2019re bringing the freshest combination of your favorite flavors directly to you. Next time you see an audacious, electric blue truck, best described as \u201cAsian Cool\u201d it might be Yumbii coming right at you!",
