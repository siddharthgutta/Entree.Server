  "description": "Straight from Binghamton NY, Spiedies are here in Atlanta! Spiedies might just be one of the nation's best kept culinary secrets - a small town favorite begging to be introduced to the hungry foodies of the south! The concept of Spiedies came to Binghamton, NY in the 1920's and for some reason never left the area. Best described as cubed, all white meat chicken, marinated in a blend of spices for days, these Spiedies are grilled right on the truck for ultimate freshness, and served on an Amorosa roll, in a wrap, or straight on the skewer! This great truck offers many awesome flavors, original, buffalo, lemon garlic, southwest, and chicken bbq! Check it out!",
