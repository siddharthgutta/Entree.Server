  "description": "While the gelato industry has grown significantly over the past 20 years, growth has been restricted to large urban areas in the Northeast.  Our vision at Honeysuckle is to combine the rich and smooth texture of gelato, a dessert that has been embraced and perfected by our friends up North, with the decadent flavors and desserts of the South.  Our wide range of artisanal treats will surely surpass your expectations.  Whether you indulge in one of our delicious gelato cookies, with flavors such as honey lavender, chocolate amaretto or marzipan sandwiched between freshly baked chocolate chip cookies or brownies; or simply try our gelato and sorbet pints we assure you that Honeysuckle's line of frozen desserts is the perfect ending to any meal.",
