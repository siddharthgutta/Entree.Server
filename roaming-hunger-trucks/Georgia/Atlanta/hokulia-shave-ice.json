  "description": "Hokulia shave ice, unlike most commercial shave ice stands, uses actual shaved ice, so that it is not ground and gritty, but smooth and refreshing. With syrups made from 100% pure cane sugar and each shave ice topped with rich flavors that are imported from Hawaii, who could pass up such a delicious frozen treat? Hiding a center of ice cream and topped with creamy sweetened condensed milk, this shave ice is so good you will think you are on the Islands enjoying a \u201ctaste of Hawaii.\u201d",
