Once we raised the money to fix it up, we set out to create a unique menu in easy-to-carry street food configurations, influenced by local Southern comfort food as well as Asian, Mexican, and Indian flavors. There\u2019s also a healthy dose of whatever we think tastes good with fresh, seasonal ingredients from local farms!",
