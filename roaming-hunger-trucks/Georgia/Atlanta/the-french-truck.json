  "description": "The French Truck was founded in 2012 inspired by a passion for bringing high quality ingredients in exquisitely crafted cr\u00eapes to our neighbors here in Atlanta.  We make every effort to be sure all our ingredients are as organic as possible and sourced both locally in Georgia and from independently owned purveyors around the country, and we pay extra attention to seasonality and sustainability when selecting them all.  The end result is the finest balance of flavor and style we can bring to our craft.  Keep an eye out for The French Truck and our fellow food trucks while we drive to grow Atlanta into a renowned street food culture.",
