  "description": "Handcrafted New Orleans inspired Snoballs! Our customized Snoballs start with a block of ice that is made using filtered water. Then, it is finely shaved giving it the consistency of fluffy snow. Our handcrafted organic syrup is then poured over top, along with toppings, and even stuffed with ice cream if you like. All served in a compostable cup! This Snoball will give you mouth-watering flavor in every bite!",
