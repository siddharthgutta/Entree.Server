  "description": "Taza is taking the tasty flavors from Athens, Greece to Athens, Georgia, and everyone agrees that this food is fantastic. In 2014, two super cool UGA students took their mutual love for Mediterranean cuisine, and a found a way to benefit the community by making healthy yet inexpensive homemade food with locally grown ingredients, providing lively and caring service (just like what they had witnessed in places like Egypt & Greece), and donating a portion of their profits to Sparrow\u2019s Nest, a local charity that helps the homeless in countless ways. Their menu features their famous Falafel Wrap- warm pita, roasted red pepper hummus, green leaf lettuce, tomato, feta cheese, their signature unforgettable falafel-fried pickles, and remoulade sauce. You\u2019ll also find other treats like Pita & Hummus, Yogurt Parfaits, and once you take a bite of their Baklava, you too will believe it\u2019s the best. For food that\u2019s great for your soul and body, take a trip to Taza or have them cater your next party. ",
