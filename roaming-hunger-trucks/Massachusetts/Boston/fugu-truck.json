  "description": "Our inspiration comes from the street food culture found all over Asia.  Growing up as a kid in Harbin, Bing was fascinated by street vendors dishing out snacks to the passer-by.  Whether it was grilled lamb on a skewer, steam buns, or sweet potatoes roasted over charcoal, being able to experience that street culture was something special.\u200b  After moving to the States, it was difficult to relive those indelible food memories.  So why not start making Asia's street foods with the great local ingredients available in Boston?  After a few phone calls between Bing and his college buddies, the food truck idea was born.  With the Fugu Truck, we will be able to bring authentic street food to a convenient location for everyone to enjoy.",
