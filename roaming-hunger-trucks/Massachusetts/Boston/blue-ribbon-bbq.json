All of Blue Ribbon's barbecue is cooked at low temperatures for long periods of time over oak and hickory hardwoods, producing moist, bold, flavorful meats. You'll feel as though you've been brought back to a lost version of America. The result of passion-driven cooks who have spent years around the fire pits perfecting the meats, this barbecue may just be the best you taste.",
