  "description": "The first Uyghur food truck in America! The Uyghurs are a Turkic people and the majority of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Having achieved sovereignty periodically throughout history, the Uyghurs today are under Chinese rule.  The feature food of the Uyghurs is the incredible Lamb Kebab, often simply prepared allowing the quality of the meat to shine. Lamb Kebabs roasting over coals and nan, a leavened flatbread cooked in a Tandoor oven, are common street foods for Uyghurs. Don't miss out on this delicious taste of a lesser-known culture!",
