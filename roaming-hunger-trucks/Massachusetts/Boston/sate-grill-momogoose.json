Inspired by the flavors and quality of Saigon and Southeast Asian street food, Sat\u00c3\u00a9 Grill rolled into Boston in 2011 as the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first gourmet food truck. Sat\u00c3\u00a9 Grill instantly garnered national acclaim for its delectable menu made entirely from locally sourced ingredients (free of preservatives, gluten, and artificial flavorings), as well as their record efficiency. Despite attracting long lines, The Sat\u00c3\u00a9 Grill team takes pride in emulating their namesake \"Sat\u00c3\u00a9\" (hot and sizzling) by satisfying every customer with fast and friendly service. In addition to serving incredible food, Sat\u00c3\u00a9 Grill significantly benefits the community by using biodegradable and green-certified materials, limiting waste, and sponsoring a charity project each year with a portion of their proceeds. If you are hungry for change, your order\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up at Sat\u00c3\u00a9 Grill. ",
