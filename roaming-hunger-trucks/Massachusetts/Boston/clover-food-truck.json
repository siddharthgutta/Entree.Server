  "description": "We\u2019re here to make food you love, the kind you talk about and look forward to eating. The Clover Food Truck is serving up a new type of fast food. This food is local, it\u2019s just-cut, when we can it will be organic.I always loved the food trucks at MIT when I was a student. September 2008 I thought: what better way to kick things off pre-restaurant than with a truck of our own. A bunch of things fell into place and here we are.The menu will be changing with the seasons, and we\u2019ll keep the latest posted on this site. You can expect french fries made from just-cut PEI potatoes, fresh juices like you\u2019ve never had before, perfect sandwiches, and we\u2019ll be ladling out just-made soups in the winter, salads in the summer.So keep an eye on this site to follow the journey!",
