  "description": "From a heap of crispy fish \u2018n chips to a steaming cup of chowder or the Captain\u2019s medley of savory fish cakes, everything on the Table & TakeAway menu is a crowd pleaser. While Captain Marden\u2019s may conger up images of fresh haddock and mussels, the Table & TakeAway is not just for lunch and dinner. The chefs also create all manner of morning specialties\u2014from fresh muffins and coffee for those on the fly, to stick-to-your-ribs classics like scrambled eggs, sausage and home fries.Regardless of the meal, however, the motto at the Table & Takeaway, is always the same: Nothing fancy. Everything delicious.",
