  "description": "A classic New England treat, the Whoopie Pie, has now gone mobile with the birth of The Whoo(pie) Wagon. This delicious dessert truck offers whoopie pies in a variety of mouth-watering flavors such as Pumpkin, Gingerbread, and Red Velvet to name a few. They even feature a \"Whoopie Burger\" - a vanilla whoopie pie with a chocolate filling that they've dressed up to look just like a burger. For your creamy whoopie pie center you can choose between a cream cheese filling or a more traditional whipped filling. If you've got a sweet tooth the Whoo(pie) Wagon should be first on your list.
