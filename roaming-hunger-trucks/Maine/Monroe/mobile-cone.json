  "description": "City: MonroeMobile Cone's ice cream is handmade using all natural ingredients at our small farm in Monroe.  We use local, Jersey milk from Hilltop Farm, cream, cane sugar (no high fructose corn syrup) and natural flavorings and extracts. We strive to use Maine grown fruit and maple syrup.  Our ice cream contains very little over-run (the amount of air incorporated into the ice cream) resulting in a rich tasting, creamy treat. Try our ice cream we think you'll love it!",
