You\u2019ll find phenomenal fillings like\u2026The Buffalo- chicken, Frank\u2019s Red Hot Sauce, cheddar & mozzarellaThe NZ- shredded beef brisket, diced sweet onions, and thick gravyThai Pie- (vegetarian) spicy green coconut curry sauce, sweet onions, red & yellow peppers, and leekand more! You can also opt for any of these fillings to be piled high in a deep fried pizza cone- they call it the Ziggy Cone.And feel free to order up a side of Straight-Cut or Sweet Potato Fries with your pie, they\u2019re both local favorites. So do a little jig over to this big ole truck and dig into some delicious Ziggy\u2019s. ",
