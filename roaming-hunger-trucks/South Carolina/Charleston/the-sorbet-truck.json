The sorbet Truck is featured at the Johns Island Farmers Market every Saturday and we're at Folly Beach every Sunday. Some of our most sought after flavors are the Raspberry Lime Jalape\u00f1o, the Strawberry Basil, the Pi\u00f1a Colada, and the Beet Pistachio. We have an endless variety and special offerings for holiday or party fare. We also serve grilled cheese with a variety of cheeses and sliced vegetables. ",
