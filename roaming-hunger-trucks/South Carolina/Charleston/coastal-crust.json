The custom-built truck also houses a coal fired grill when the need arises to provide freshly grilled toppings such as peppers, onions, skirt steak, shrimp, and much more to the party.In addition to pizza, this truck also offers salad, fresh Italian Gelato and Espresso, with many ingredients sourced locally.
