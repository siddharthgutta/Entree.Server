  "description": "ThoroughFARE started when husband and wife team Neil and Jessica Barley teamed up to share their amazing food with others. Neil began cooking in high school, and it soon turned into a passion, taking him all the way through culinary school and beyond. He met Jessica while working in catering in southeast Georgia, and they soon began working together. Thoroughfare was the next logical step.So what will you find at Thoroughfare? Well, it changes from day to day, but great sandwiches, tacos, and disco tots have all made appearances, as well as specially-crafted eats for catering events. One things's for sure: whatever fare you order, it will be thoroughly good.",
