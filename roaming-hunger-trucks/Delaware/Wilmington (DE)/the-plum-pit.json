  "description": "The Plum Pit is dishing out some pleasing Modern World Cuisine throughout the streets of the Tri-State area and with a menu so delicious, this is one of the best trucks you could pick. The greatest and freshest ingredients go into their selection of sandwiches, rice bowls, and tacos with your choice of juicy pulled pork, savory smoked chicken, or fresh hot fried tofu (and more!). Their beef or jerk chicken empanadas are also famously tasty, and if you\u2019ve got room for sides, you simply must partake in their mac n\u2019 cheese or bay fries. Next time you\u2019ve got an appetite for something scrumptious, permit yourself to eat at this truck, or if you happen to be planning a party, \u201cbe a hit and book The Plum Pit!\u201d",
