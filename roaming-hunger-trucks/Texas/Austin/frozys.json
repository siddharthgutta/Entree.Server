  "description": "Frozy's is local, family-owned business established in 2011.  We strive to deliver the highest quality shaved ice with the best customer service.  We developed the Frozy (rhymes with cozy) brand originally thinking we were going to open a frozen yogurt store but quickly diverted to the shaved ice trailer business as there were no consistent options in the West Austin & Lake Travis communities.  Our entire family loves shaved ice so we are very passionate about the business.  If you have any questions or suggestions for us, please feel free to contact us!  Thanks for visiting Frozy's & make it a snow day.",
