  "description": "East Side King was created by Paul Qui and Moto Utsunomiya as a side project when they were working at Uchi and Uchiko. It provided a space for creative freedom and fun with food, and it has grown to include talent like Yoshi Okai, locations like Hole In The Wall, Grackle, Liberty Bar and Shangri-La, and menus that range from Curry Buns to Sapporo Beer Bacon Miso Ramen.They are inspired by \"Asian cultures, rock bands, art (like the amazing art by Peelander Yellow that graces our food trucks and walls), and Austin\u2019s laid-back, experimental, fun-loving vibe.\"If that doesn't have you convinced yet, just consider this: From the Curry Buns to the Yaki Imo, there is no better food this side of Austin. If these eats don't bring you to tears, it's because there is no joy left in your soul. So stop by one of East Side King's trailers, and see for yourself what all the fuss is about! We guarantee you'll be back for more.",
