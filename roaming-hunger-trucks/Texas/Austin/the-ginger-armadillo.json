  "description": "The Ginger Armadillo is not a BBQ truck, not a burger or a taco truck\u2014but it might just be all those things. This Austin food truck can take quintessential Texas cuisine and give it a gourmet spin, or international dishes and give them a Texas spin. The menu changes monthly based on what\u2019s local and in season, so you\u2019ll never have to have the same thing twice... but you\u2019ll want to!",
