  "description": "A passion for flavorful food and family inspired the genesis of The Flying Carpet. Owners Maria & Abderrahim Souktouri merged their love of Moroccan food, a desire to eat quality fare economically, and Austin\u2019s street food scene to open a food trailer such as they had encountered in their travels to Morocco. The food served at The Flying Carpet is all natural. That means premium everything; from organic vegetables, to vegetarian fed chemical/hormone free eggs and meat. The Flying Carpet\u2019s motto is \u2018food translates\u2019, because Maria & Abderrahim believe that sitting down to a meal with friends and family is one of the most important things we do in life. Food is a language we all speak. \u201cWe are neither chefs nor restaurateurs, we are just people who live to serve, eat and make food for the ones we love. We hope to see you at the trailer; it is much like our home, loud, warm and full of love!\u201d",
