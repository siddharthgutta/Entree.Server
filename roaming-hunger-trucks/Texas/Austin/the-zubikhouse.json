  "description": "The ZubikHouse Story.Est. 2009, The ZubikHouse is a high-dollar boom boom room. Taken over by the Bolivian government in 2001, we managed to bounce back and make Kolaches the new Haute Snack.We trully make the greastest Kolache man has ever experienced. It's rumored that Aliens influenced this recipe...not true.Our menu follows the concessionaire's philosophy: Food in one hand, drink in the other. Everything has to be fast and affordable. With slower crowds we'll add a little more variety, but when the lines get too long the menu becomes a lot more simple; i.e. \"The Kolache.\"In April of 2010, The ZubikHouse became the first trailer to start serving at the downtown Austin farmer\u2019s Market, what they call \u201cTexas Czech\u201d cuisine. This includes smoked meats, BBQ, some traditional Kolaches as well as a \u201cCzech-Mex\u201d: pulled pork with Jalepeno & onion relish Kolache. When in season they\u2019ll\u2019ll bring out an original \u201cFried strawberry\u201d with white chocolate sauce and balsamic vinegar reduction. ",
