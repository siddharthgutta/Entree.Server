  "description": "Austin has been home to Food Works Catering since 2011, back when the owners first came together and decided to combine their culinary experiences and talents, and transfer them toward a mission to give their menu mobility. Four years later and now there is a fleet of six trucks catering to the crowds, who are constantly wowed by the fabulous food from Food Works. Their menu features quite a selection of foodie favorites, including their signature Thanksgiving Club with turkey, stuffing, cranberry and pepper gravy. Or their  traditional Turkey Club with turkey, cheese, organic lettuce, tomato, bacon and mayo. Their Shrimp Po' Boy, Famous Grilled Cheese Sandwiches, and Jalapeno Poppers are all must-tries as well. With such consistent quality, efficiency, care, and craft, it\u2019s no wonder that Food Works Catering absolutely works! ",
