  "description": "Ms P has been perfecting her fried chicken for years and has always wondered why there aren't any REALLY GOOD FRIED CHICKEN places in Austin. Her friends and family have always said \"you should open up your own fried chicken joint.\" Chef Cuz, who is an accomplished Chef, has always dreamed of having his own place. So they are teaming up, rigging a food trailer and are serving the best Fried Chicken in the \"ATX\".With a Texas two-step brining process, fresh herbs and 12 spices, Ms P adds the finishing touch and fries it up in top quality peanut oil. Best of all, Ms P only serves FRESH, never frozen, no hormones, no additives, LOCAL free range chicken. The end result is the most flavorful, moist, crispy, fried chicken that has ever passed your lips. Come sit down at Ms P's kitchen table and share stories, laugh and have a cold beverage. Be sure to give a holla' to Ms P and Chef Cuz too.",
