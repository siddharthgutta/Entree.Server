  "description": "The fastest Bun Slinger in Texas is buckin\u2019 his truck through town and wrangling all the appetites around with a hearty selection of franks and sausages with toppings so tasty, it\u2019s no wonder this chuck is everyone\u2019s \u2018most wanted\u2019. Come saddle on up to this truck and hog-tie yourself a \u201cWinchester\u201d- Jumbo Hebrew National Kosher All Beef Frank, or a \u201cColt 45 \u201d- Pork Jalapeno Sausage Wrapped in a Tortilla- and heap on your choice of chili, cheese, saut\u00e9ed onions, mustard, jalape\u00f1os, or Bun Slinger\u2019s own Trail Blazin\u2019 Frank Sauce- it\u2019s fired up with enough flavor and spice to even knock Jesse James\u2019 spurs right off and send him right outta dodge. And If you\u2019re fixin\u2019 to throw a big hoedown, be sure to invite Bun Slinger, and your guests will certainly be impressed by all his great chow.  Whether you\u2019re a cowboy, outlaw, or even a yankee, you\u2019ll find the grub at Wild West Franks to be the darn tootin\u2019 best. ",
