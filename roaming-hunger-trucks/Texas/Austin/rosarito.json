  "description": "Rosarito is an Austin food truck serving the 'Baja Taco,' a natural fusion between the Mexican pacific seafood, and Asian traditions. When Japanese fisherman arrived at the pacific coast, they showed the Mexican cooks their tempura tradition, and a blending of spices from the two cultures emerged, bringing a special hint of Asia into the Baja cuisine. So stop by Rosarito and be inspired and thrilled by Baja Californian and Asian gastronomy in an original, delicious form.",
