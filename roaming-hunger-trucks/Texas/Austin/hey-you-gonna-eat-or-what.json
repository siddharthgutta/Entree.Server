You Gonna Eat or What? is known for (among other things!) it's Shiner Bock beer-battered Monte Cristo - served with a hommemade Cherry & Fig jelly. Our permanent menu featurs 4 incredible sandwiches but don't be misled... Our menu of \"Specials\" always offers up a wide variety of cool, new looks. There's something for everybody!...
