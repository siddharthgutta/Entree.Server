Simple ingredients of popcorn, corn oil, sugar, salt, and a little vanilla draw in the crowds with the yummy smell. The All Natural Fruit Shaved Ices are a Las Nieves product that feature fruit pureed and whipped in ice, and flavors such as watermelon, lime, mango and others offer a refreshing natural treat. If you're hungry for some tasty snacks, find this trailer at an event, or bring it to you!",
