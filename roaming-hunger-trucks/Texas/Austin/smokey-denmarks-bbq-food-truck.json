Albert C. \u201cSmokey\u201d Denmark (with his wife at his side) began his business in Austin, the capital city of Texas, after learning from the legendary sausage makers of Central Texas.  From 1972 (when he retired) to the present, our family, like Smokey, has continued to adhere to the highest standards.Time honored recipes, proven methods, modern food processing equipment, and careful attention to detail enable us to consistently produce even better products today than in decades past.  As Smokey used to say, \u201cquality products have few real competitors\u201d.\u201cQuality products have few real competitors\u201d.Our business has always been dedicated to premium quality products and outstanding service to our customers.  As Christians, we abide not only by the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d principle but also the Biblical admonitions to be fair and to render a full measure in our dealings with others.
