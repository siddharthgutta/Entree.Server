  "description": "The Best Wurst has been a staple fixture of Austin\u2019s 6th street since the early 90\u2019s. The original business dubbed Flamin\u2019 Hots by Syracuse transplants Steve and Pam Novelli, set up in the doorway of a dubious jewelry-pawn shop that is currently the location for Scruffy\u2019s convenient store. In those days, the only other food vendor was Johnny Johnson and his hot dog carts. A crazed character that boasted about his being set up in the Federal Witness Protection Program, Johnny eventually disappeared.In1995, friend and fellow Syracuse transplant Jon Notarthomas took over operations where Best Wurst settled on 6th and San Jacinto, its current location. Now, Best Wurst is one of the oldest continuously running businesses in the famed party district.",
