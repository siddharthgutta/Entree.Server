  "description": "This super  sleek airstream trailer with the revolving cupcake top that\u2019s just calling your name to come get yourself a delicious gourmet handheld treat, is an absolute Austin icon ever since it first arrived on South Congress in 2007. Hey Cupcake! can even be credited with creating the city\u2019s food truck/trailer scene, as it was one of the first to appear and draw all this foodie love. Everyone can\u2019t help but indulge in Hey Cupcake\u2019s selection of cute, fluffy, yummy, creamy cupcakes, like the 24 Carrot (carrot cake with cream cheese frosting), John Lemon (lemon cake with lemon buttercream), Vanilla Dream (vanilla cake with vanilla buttercream and sprinkles), The Standard (vanilla cake with chocolate buttercream and sprinkles), just to name a few. Come on out and be a part of sweet history with every bite of scrumptious goodness that you get from Hey Cupcake!",
