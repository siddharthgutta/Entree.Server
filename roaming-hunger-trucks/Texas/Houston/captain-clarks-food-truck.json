  "description": "Clark & Amber fell in love with fresh hot fried fish while living by the beaches of Galveston. After moving back to the Bayou City and having zero luck finding restaurants serving fish that was quite as delicious, this cool couple took on the challenge themselves. After extensive preparation, Captain Clark\u2019s Food Truck has hit the streets of Houston and is slinging out an incredibly tasty selection of Fish n\u2019 Chips (with Texas-true Lone Star Beer-Battered Cod), Shrimp n\u2019 Chips (with the perfect Panko crunch), and more. Whether you\u2019re craving something amazing for your next meal or your next big event, Captain Clark\u2019s Food Truck has got exactly what you need. ",
