  "description": "Jay & Tai (the husband and wife dream team) are taking tasty Texas-style \u2018Q all throughout the streets of Houston. Every ounce of their delicious Southern food is made with love and care, from the juicy smoked meats (like brisket, ribs, sausage,), to the beefy sandwiches (burgers, hot dogs, BBQ), to the comforting side items (cole slaw, gumbo,  mac n cheese), their famously luscious loaded baked potatoes, and of course, their divinely sweet desserts (like Sweet Potato Pie, Peach Cobbler). With all this and much more, you simply must try the heavenly cuisine from Jay & Tai\u2019s BBQ. ",
