  "description": "Frosted Betty was founded on the idea of creating community through baked goods made with love. Corners are never cut, and we bake from scratch every morning with only the best ingredients. Not only are our ingredients very important to us, but we also care about the impact we have on our environment. At Frosted Betty we believe in taking a proactive role in our community.We use fresh local organic products, choose recycled or biodegradable material for our packaging and are committed to creating baked goods in a responsible and sustainable manner. We donate to our local food banks and hold special events to help raise money for local charities. We offer quality-catering services for ANY occasion. From large corporate events to small business meetings, from weddings to galas or grand openings, to holidays, private parties or girls night out; we can customize your order to fit your event and your style.
