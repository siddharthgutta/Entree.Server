  "description": "Mike and Tony have graced Houstonians with their El Topo truck, in which they exercise a modern approach to creating traditional authentic Mesoamerican cuisine, and the result is staggeringly exquisite and delicious. Staying true to their mission to serve meals that are exclusively \u201cFarm to fork, tail to snout. Mythic, modern, romantic,\u201d Mike and Tony make all their ingredients themselves, including their home-cured bacon and hand-pressed tortillas. This tremendous level of skill and care is not lost on local foodies, as they savor every moment of this thoroughly flavorful culinary experience. Whether it\u2019s time for breakfast or lunch, come visit El Topo to taste (and adore) their selection of top tacos. ",
