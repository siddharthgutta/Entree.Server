  "description": "The Muiishi Truck combines Korean dishes with classic Japanese, and American flavors. They describe themselves as casual and gourmet, so even if you're wearing a raggedy t-shirt and ripped jeans you can still expect an innovative and deliciously crafted meal. Some must try items are the Mac n' Cheese eggrolls and the Bacon Jammin' Karaage Biscuits (Asian chicken nuggets with cheddar biscuits and a bourbon bacon jam). ",
