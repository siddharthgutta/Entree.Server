  "description": "Everybody can make a Taco...but a Great Taco is what makes Luchi and Joey's Awesome! Taking our passion to the streets one person at a time.Luchi and Joey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s culinary journey began in Chiapas, Mexico, where each gained an early appreciation for fresh, home made foods. For Joey, the experience began every day after school in his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kitchen, learning the importance of fresh ingredients and the proper combination of spices. For Luchi, whose family was in the poultry business, the understanding of how to properly handle and prepare chicken formed the foundation on which to build.After college, Luchi and Joey were married and began making frequent trips to Houston. In addition to enjoying the easygoing atmosphere, they were impressed by the number of restaurants in the city, which they believed indicated a robust demand for a quality dining experience. The decision was made to move to Houston and, eight months later, Frontier Barbecue was born.",
