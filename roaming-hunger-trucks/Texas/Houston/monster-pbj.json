  "description": "Monster PBJ is a Houston food truck serving customized PB&J; sandwiches + free jokes with every purchase. We are all-vegetarian, vegan-friendly and we also offer gluten-free bread and chips. We allow each customer to create their perfect PB&J; by choosing from a variety of nut butters + fresh fruit + jam + sweet toppings. All our nut butters contain only nuts and are fresh-ground by us every day. We offer 3 different sandwiches and if you want, we\u2019ll cut the crust off, just like mom. We can also grill your sandwich (highly recommended) and offer 4 different styles of cuts. Pair your PB&J; with a drink, chips and a vegan dessert and you\u2019ve got a monsterlicious meal. ",
