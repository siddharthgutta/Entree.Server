  "description": "Blue Crystal Rotisserie Food Truck is serving up spit-roasted chickens and pork that are \"Fast, Fresh and Delicious\". We are serving whole, half and quarter roast  chicken and pork loin accompanied by herb roasted potatoes, rice pilaf and seasonal vegetables.Blue Crystal Rotisserie chicken is marinated in our signature blend of spices, herbs, and peppers for over 48 hours. The method we use to cook our birds is a low and slow technique which makes the chicken unbelievably juicy and very flavorful. Plus the mixture of cumin, saffron and secret spices makes Blue Crystal Rotisserie a one of a kind food truck. We hope our concept of using open flame and fresh local ingredients will bring a different taste and style to the food truck nation in Houston!Blue Crystal is also a mobile kitchen also so we can cook what ever you want.",
