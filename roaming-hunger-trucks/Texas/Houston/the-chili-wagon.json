One of the first opportunities presented to the young adults in this program is to run The Chili Wagon and serve the people of Houston 100% natural and delicious chili dishes. All employees of the truck receive on-site job training and a large portion of the proceeds goes toward Angel Reach to help fund their many beneficial programs.
