  "description": "What is a cake ball? It\u2019s your favorite cake combined with the right flavor of icing, then rolled into shape, and dipped in creamy chocolate creating the perfect balance of cake and candy. But don\u2019t stop there. They are made fresh when you order them and will stay fresh in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks (not that anyone has ever kept them that long\u2026).Try the cake pops for special occasions too! Same as a cake ball, then stuck on a lollipop and decorated to match your theme. Cake Pop Baskets and Deluxe Baskets add flair to any gathering! Bunco night, baby showers, retirement parties, Friday night movie night, birthday (great as party favors) and so much more.Lots of fun and lots of smiles! Contact me to see how we can make your next dinner party, birthday or Friday night a success.",
