  "description": "After feeling that El Paso was being unfairly left behind in the famous Texas BBQ scene, the team at Vic\u2019s felt that it was their duty to deliciously right this wrong with their very own mobile selection of BBQ creations. Vic\u2019s is serving up perfectly juicy and smoky brisket, pulled pork, spare ribs, turkey, and so much more. Whether you choose a sandwich or a platter with a few of your favorite sides (like mac \u2018n cheese, coleslaw, or cream corn), once you try a bite of any of this, you will find that along with the rest of El Paso, you just can\u2019t pass up the delicious flavors from Vic\u2019s!",
