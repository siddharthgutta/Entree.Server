  "description": "Callie's Cajun is serving gourmet Cajun food on wheels to the curbsides of Corpus Christi! Callie's Cajun was started in a funky old smokehouse trailer in Santa Fe NM in 1999, but after 12 years in the high desert, Callie was more than ready to return to her Gulf Coast roots. Now you can find the truck around Corpus Christi, and grab yourself the best damn Cajun food this side of anywhere!",
