  "description": "This big ole blue truck is wagging its way through Central Texas and blazing up plates of the best doggone brisket, ribs, beef, (and more) that you\u2019ll find in the Lone Star State. And you better believe that this rotisserie-style BBQ is finger lickin\u2019 delicious. Their sides include coleslaw, potato salad, and luscious loaded fries. Local folks love this quality food so come out and bite (don\u2019t bark) into some Big Dog BBQ. You\u2019ll most likely share their positive point of view. ",
