  "description": "Local legend is that Professor Franklyn Neville Furter traveled the country near and far in pursuit of historical hints as to which worldly condiments he could use to top his favorite comfort cuisine: the hot dog. Thanks to Laura and Gerald, his relics of recipes live on through the scrumptious sausages and wieners that this Texas truck is serving up.Come marvel at the 8th Wonder: Their jumbo dog wrapped in bacon, deep fried, then nuzzled in their artisan bun, along with their tasty 3-cheese spread. Get pumped for the Pompeii: their spicy italian sausage topped with mozzarella cheese and homemade bolognese. There are even more gourmet options that you\u2019re sure to adore. Whatever you choose, you\u2019ll take a big chomp out of one of these delicious dogs and you\u2019ll think to yourself, \u201cWhat a wonderful world of wieners.\u201d",
