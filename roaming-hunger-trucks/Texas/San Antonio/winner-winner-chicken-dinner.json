Of course we have other stuff on our menu but you have to come out and try us!THE WWCD-A combination of sweet and spicy meets our Original Winner Winner Chicken Dinner. We start by marinating our chicken tenders in jalapeno juice and coating them in an almond, sesame seed, corn flake, sugar, and chili powder mixture. It all comes together on a homemade tortilla, some raspberry chipotle coleslaw, and a fried avocado (in that same delicous coating). Southwest Chipotle sauce ...on the top adds the final touch.Other Menu options:1.
