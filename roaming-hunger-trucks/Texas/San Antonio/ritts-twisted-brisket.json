  "description": "We are a Mobile kitchen located in Boerne, Texas, working in San Antonio and the Hill Country serving BBQ with a twist.  We strive to not be like every other BBQ truck in that we make items with our slow smoked brisket.  Our signature dish is brisket served in a waffle cone.  Nachos, tacos, stuffed baked potatoes, tornadoes, are some of our menu items.  We will also have sandwiches and/or sliders. We also cater for private parties and groups.",
