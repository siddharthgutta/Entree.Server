  "description": "Yum Yum Truck has a menu of wonderful Latin cuisine, which includes fresh made tacos, burritos, hot sandwiches, breakfast tacos and burritos, mixed bowls, salads, etc. everything is made fresh, nothing premade or prepackaged. We also offer periodic specials, such as The Cuban Sandwich we served a couple of days ago. We've served this before and were asked to bring it back. It's an amazing combination of Roasted Pork, Baked Honey Ham, and assorted fixings. It really is wonderful. In addition to the items I mentioned and some that I haven't, we also make fresh veggie versions of everything we carry. AND we make special orders on request, made with anything we happen to haven the truck. We literally will make anything you ask for, as long as we have the ingredients. We take great pride and pleasure in spoiling our customers. And they Love It!!",
