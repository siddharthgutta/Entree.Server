  "description": "Though much of the spotlight is put on Germany's beer, let us not forget one of the most amazing German culinary inventions: the schnitzel. Incase you're unfamiliar, the schnitzel is a cutlet of meat that has been pounded flat, then breaded, fried, and topped with lettuce, tomato, onion, and cucumber. At Ketzler's you can top your schnitzel with a variety of tasty toppings. Another German delight on the menu is the traditional bratwurst, a juicy sausage served on a steak roll.  ",
