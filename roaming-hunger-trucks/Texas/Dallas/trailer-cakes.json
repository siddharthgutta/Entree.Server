  "description": "At Trailercakes, our goal is to always serve the best tasting cupcakes you\u2019ve ever had, while evoking nostalgic emotions of happiness and bliss. We believe that being laid back and fun can and should exist without compromising a standard of quality. Happiness comes in many forms, and we hope to summon those emotions the moment the first bit of frosting hits the lips. That, to us, is the icing on the cake and why we like to say \u2018happiness is in the frosting.",
