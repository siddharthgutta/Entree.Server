  "description": "The 1st sushi food truck in Dallas! Bringing inexpensive, quality sushi to Texans with a couple of cool surprises. 12 special sauces... Its all about the sauce!Crazy fish is not traditional. And when I say tradition I mean let\u2019s take out the kimonos, cherry blossoms, elevator music and creepy crawly style sushi out of the equation.  Then\u2026 let\u2019s replace it with some more interesting twists. Our menu is organic, our fish is wild and our meats are free range. No cages here!  To go along with our wildness we add some color to the equation. All sauces will be on the side. With six different specialty sauces to choose from you can be the master dipper. As we have a selection of more children friendly sushi, children can dip their own sushi and choose from a range of colored rice paper instead of seaweed that may seem too scary. We will also offer a full cooked selection for the finicky most stubborn children. Sushi will not only be organic white rice but brown rice and wild rice as well.",
