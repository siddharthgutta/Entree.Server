  "description": "Once Paul & Jackie Dietzler discovered that there are over 1.8 million hungry children in Texas alone, they were instantly inspired to help in any way they could. Thus Paul formed Matthew 6 Ministries, a plan to build a series of volunteer-run Christian-based restaurants that will donate all proceeds to aid local communities with homeless and hungry children. While they are gaining restaurant building funds, the M6M Shaved Ice trailer is serving as their first non-profit entity and has already begun making its way through all the concerts, festivals, birthday, etc\u2026 around the area. Indulging in this fun and fruity shaved ice is the perfect way to cool off during a hot Texas day. It\u2019s even more refreshing to know that all the profits are helping the world become a better and safer place for children. For your next event, be sure to do something divinely nice and invite M6M Shaved Ice to come bring the treats. ",
