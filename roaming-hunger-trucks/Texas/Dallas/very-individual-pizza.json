  "description": "PIZZA VS FLATBREAD... What's the difference?Pizza is pizza, right? Some kind of crust, pizza sauce and cheese with toppings...?As our palate starts to break down a concept into sub-concepts new names start to evolve. Thus, the flatbread was born. Flatbread in the larger sense is still pizza, however it allows you to move away from tradition and into an artistic land where a pizza crust is the canvas.Flatbread can be identified as:Rogue pizza! Sauce and ingredients that follow no rules, can be from across the globe, and may or may not contain cheese.Plenty of rogue pizza creations at V.I.Pizza. Step out of your pizza box and let us be the artist.",
