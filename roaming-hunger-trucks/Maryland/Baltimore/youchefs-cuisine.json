  "description": "We cater all types of cuisines and give our customers a hands-on experience in creating a menu with a chef. I was a chef of the Maryland Jockey Club, which gave me a lot of banquet experience and helped hone my culinary skils.  I look forward to satisfying palates and turning customers into extended family. There is no event which is too small. We do three-course dinners to banquet styles with buffets, action stations, etc. events. We want everyone's experience to feel more like they are a part of their own creation!",
