The Italians subs are scrumptious and huge, stuffed with options like Sausage, Green Peppers, & Onion, Porchetta (slow-roasted seasoned pork heaped on a sub roll and topped with broccoli rabe), Caprese, and Chicken Parmigiana--and these are only just a few!Folks are raving about the pasta too, like the creamy Mushroom Ravioli, Fusilli Bolognese, and the Penne Pasta topped with broccoli rabe, sausage, and goat cheese. For a mobile menu with all this and more, you just must make your way straight to Pasta La Vista, Baby!",
