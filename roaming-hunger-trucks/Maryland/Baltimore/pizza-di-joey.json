  "description": "Pizza di Joey's founder and lead chef, Joey Vanoni, served in the United States Navy for almost a decade before making his foray into the world of street food. With his lifetime of experience making pizzas everywhere from one of the country's 1st pizzerias to hundreds of feet under the ocean in a submarine, Chef Joey felt it was time to bring his brick pizza oven to the streets of Baltimore.Pizza di Joey is fully staffed by veterans of the US armed forces, including former servicemen and women who were injured in the line of duty, and uses organic and locally sourced ingredients whenever possible.",
