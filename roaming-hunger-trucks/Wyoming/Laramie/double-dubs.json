  "description": "The amazing wings that Double Dub\u2019s is dishing out are all the craze in Laramie. The masters at this truck have perfected the art of frying chicken (wings, tenders, and sandwiches) until it\u2019s reached optimum crunch while the meat remains tender and juicy. Locals rave about the homemade sauces and rubs; Habanero Mustard, Garlic Parmesan, BBQ, and Buffalo, to name a few. Just choose the perfect sauce for you, and the level of heat (1-5), they\u2019ll give your wings a generous toss, and this incredible meal is served fresh and hot for you to eat. If you think that you can beat the heat, we double dog dare you to defeat The Double Dubs Dozen Challenge- Eat 12 Dry Rubs(the hottest wings) in under 5 minutes. Win and you\u2019ll be the next big thing in the world of wings. Whether you come to Double Dubs to win or just wing it, bring your appetite because you\u2019re in for some of the tastiest grub in Laramie. ",
