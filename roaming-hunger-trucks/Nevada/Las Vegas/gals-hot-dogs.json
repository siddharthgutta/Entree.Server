  "description": "Las Vegas hot dog fans have found their haven, and that\u2019s GALS Hot Dogs. With an offering of gourmet hot dogs and a diverse selection of tasty toppings, it\u2019s no wonder this cart is a local favorite. Travel the nation with one delicious creation at a time like the Cali Dog, The Chicago Dog, and The Big Texan with tangy BBQ sauce. And don\u2019t forget to cool off from that Nevada sunshine with a delightfully sweet and refreshing sno cone. GALS is generally located in the lot of Count\u2019s Kustoms, but if you\u2019ve got a big party or event coming up, you\u2019ve gotta have this cool cart come cater. ",
