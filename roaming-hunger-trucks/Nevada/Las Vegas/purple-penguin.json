  "description": "Some people are confused about what a snowcone actually is.  We are NOT talking about crushed ice here Purple Peeps!  Our snowcones are the consistency of snow - hence the name snowcone!  Shaved ice, shave ice, snow ball, water ice - call it what you want...to us it is a snowcone.  These are old school snowcones like back in the days of your childhood.  We are all about kids having a fun place to ride their bikes to with their friends and families making memories!  No tricks here, just straight up snowcones served in Styrofoam cups with a smile! We are the ONLY snowcone shack in the Las Vegas/Henderson area!  Come see what we have to offer.  You won't be disappointed!",
