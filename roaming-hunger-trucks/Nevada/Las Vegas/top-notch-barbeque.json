  "description": "We are bringing the Southwest Cowboy flare to the Las Vegas Valley. Our meat is cooked over open flame with a dry rub to enhance the flavor.Top Notch started as a catering business and from there we expanded to a remote barbeque business for parties and all other small or large events.  In 2009, Top Notch Barbeque won first prize, after entering a Barbeque contest that was for charity which featured companies that have been in business in the Las Vegas Valley for over 20 years.The demand for our award winning barbeque and sides become so great, that we decided to expand our catering business to specialize in Barbeque and the rest is history.Stay tuned to find out where we will be next.",
