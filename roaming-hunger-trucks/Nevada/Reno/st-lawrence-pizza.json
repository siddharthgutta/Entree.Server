  "description": "St. Lawrence Pizza Co. was established in 2010 by Thomas and Heather Cushman to offer a unique, cost effective and locally based concessions and catering option to the Reno/Tahoe area. Wood fired pizzas are gaining popularity nation wide and this simple, delicious choice is now mobile. Using our custom built trailer, we can bring the pizza parlor to your home, business or event. Pizzas are prepared on-site in our state of the art fully equipped mobile kitchen, giving you piping hot pizza straight from an authentic wood fired oven. We have 4 young children, all under the age of 5! We love the outdoors and great pizza. Weekends are spent with our children, either going hiking, fishing on the Truckee river or snowshoeing. God and Family are our first priorities. Our second is Pizza!",
