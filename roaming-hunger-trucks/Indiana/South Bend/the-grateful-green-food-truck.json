  "description": "The people of South Bend, Indiana were recently endowed with their first food truck. It must have been worth the wait, because everyone\u2019s bodies and minds sure are grateful for the delicious and nourishing cuisine from The Grateful Green!Inspired by a total lack of food trucks and decent vegan/vegetarian options in the area, Jessie (a virtuous vegan) launched her mission to provide healthy and eco-friendly fare for all. Now she\u2019s truckin\u2019 and serving up breakfast, brunch, and lunch, all 100% vegan, plant-based, and mostly gluten-free. Come sample her sweet selection of smoothies and juices, all made with locally-sourced organic produce. The soups, sandwiches, and salads are all splendid as well. Thanks to Jessie and her lean, clean, green, and vegan machine, it has never felt more good to \u2018Do Good. Be Good. Eat Good.\u2019 ",
