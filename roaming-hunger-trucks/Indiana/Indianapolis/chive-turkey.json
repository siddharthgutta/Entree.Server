  "description": "After years of establishing impressive culinary careers, Chefs Will & James became fed up with corporate kitchens and decided that it's time to serve up their own crafted creations. Now you\u2019ll find them driving this whimsical purple turkey truck through the streets of the \u201cCircle City\u201d, flabbergasting all Indianapolis folk with their fantastically flavorful fowl-y food.  Locals just love their incredible menu, which includes The Chive Turkey Panini, their Potato Chip and Roasted Onion Dip Burger, and their Sweet Potato Tots with cinnamon sugar and marshmallow cream sauce, just to name a few. And there will always be a new reason to keep trotting back to this truck, as their menu is subject to change with the seasons. So jump and jive your way to Chive Turkey for some of the most high-five-worthy grub you\u2019ll ever gobble. ",
