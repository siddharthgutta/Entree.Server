  "description": "Being nice starts with using ingredients that are good for people while being environmentally responsible. We only use the best all-natural ingredients, organics when possible, and we do our best to source as close to home as possible. Want to know what's in a particular Nicey? Just ask us! We have nothing to hide! Actually, we'd be proud to tell you. We source our organic, grass-fed milk from Trader\u2019s Point Creamery, sweeteners range from agave syrup to organic evaporated cane juice, and our chocolate is from Guittard in San Francisco, California.In the words of my grandfather, \u201cGood ingredients aren\u2019t cheap and cheap ingredients aren\u2019t good.\u201d Right on Gramps!",
