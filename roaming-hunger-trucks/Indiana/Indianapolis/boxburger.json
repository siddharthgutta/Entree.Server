  "description": "BoxBurger is bringing the best American classics throughout the streets of Indiana, with its perfectly simple selection of burgers (with or without cheese) made with 100% farm raised & local black Angus beef, and placed pleasantly within a sweet Hawaiian bun. The wide variety of toppings range from the tried & true: lettuce, onion, and pickles, to premium too: bacon, blue cheese, or a scrumptious fried egg. And with a side of their hand-cut fries, seasoned with their own secret blend, you\u2019re basically in for a beautifully tasty time. So come on out to BoxBurger (or invite the trailer to your next event) for food that truly rocks. ",
