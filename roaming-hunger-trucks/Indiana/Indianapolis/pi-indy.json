  "description": "This truck is made from a shipping container and a freight liner. One whole side is made of windows so you can see everything going on inside this kitchen on wheels. They make 8\" pizzas, to order, in the wood burning brick oven. Local ingredients, innovation, experience, and a love for food really make this truck an exciting addition to the Indy streets!",
