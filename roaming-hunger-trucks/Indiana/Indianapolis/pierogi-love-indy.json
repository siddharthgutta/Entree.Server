  "description": "We moved to Indianapolis from central NY where Pierogis were a big deal, they were eaten with every meal. People who know what a Pierogi is, love them. People who have never had a Pierogi that have tried them, always come back for more. Try some of our specialty Pierogis or try the traditional saut\u00e9ed Pierogis, they're all good. We also carry 100% beef hotdogs that have been a staple of Syracuse NY since 1879 (and they're not even moldy). Our Snappys are a veal hotdog, a must try! (Excellent with spicy mustard). ",
