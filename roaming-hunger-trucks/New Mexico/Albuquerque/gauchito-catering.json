  "description": "Hey gauchos y gauchas! Ready for some \"asado\" barbecue slow cooked meats and vegetables over coals in true Argentinean cowboy style? The difference with regular barbecue is the parrilla where the food is grilled does not trap smoke making the food healthier but still tasty. We also sell empanadas, which are flaky filled baked turnovers. Meats, vegetables and empanadas are made with local ingredients. These are some of your options at Gauchito Catering. Don't forget the chimichurri sauce!We also offer flan and alfajores.",
