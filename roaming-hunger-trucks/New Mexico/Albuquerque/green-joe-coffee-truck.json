  "description": "At the young age of 14, Vincent\u2019s great-grandfather climbed aboard the \u201cGiuseppe Verdi\u201d and commenced a hopeful voyage from Italy to Ellis Island in pursuit of the American Dream. Today, Vincent himself is demonstrating this familial bravery and ambition as he climbs aboard his very own \u201cGreen Joe\u201d Coffee Truck and brews his very own dream from the ground up with every cup of joe that he serves. Ask anyone in Albuquerque and they\u2019ll tell you that they ADORE Vincent and his attentive customer service, his passion for benefitting the community, and of course his talent for concocting incredibly delicious coffee and tea. So if you\u2019re looking to support one of the loveliest local businesses around, come visit this truck that\u2019s as green as New Mexico\u2019s favorite chile, as well as this beloved barista who\u2019s pretty much the best thing to happen to this town since Breaking Bad.
