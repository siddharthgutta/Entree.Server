  "description": "ALBUQUERQUE, NM \u2014 Mac's Steak in the Rough has been an institution in New Mexico for 66 years. Founded by Dave McCarty in 1949 in Artesia, NM, McCarty opened Albuquerque's first Mac's Steak in the Rough in 1960 and the restaurant has been a local favorite ever since. The local chain was acquired by Fresquez Companies in the early 1990's and has recently given the chain a face lift with it's newly remodeled location at 4515 Menaul Blvd NE. A recent article by Thrillist named Mac's Steak in the Rough one of the best drive in restaurants in the United States. The Huffington post wrote an article titled \"Mac's Steak In The Rough: An Albuquerque Original We Adore.\"  ",
