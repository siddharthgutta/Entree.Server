  "description": "Red Hot & Blue offers authentic Southern BBQ and Southern Hospitality. Slow cooked meats, southern fried catfish, juicy burgers, and fresh salads round out a menu that focuses on quality. Meats featured on the menu, pulled pork, beef brisket, chicken and ribs, are slowly smoked for hours over hickory wood. In sticking with the southern tradition, the ribs are available \u201cwet\u201d or \u201cdry\u201d and come with one of six signature sauces. Pit Master Sonny McKnight has a quarter century of awards and recognition. \u201cEven before you wake up, we\u2019ve been smokin\u2019 your ribs for hours. That\u2019s the key \u2013 cook\u2019em low and slow.\u201d",
