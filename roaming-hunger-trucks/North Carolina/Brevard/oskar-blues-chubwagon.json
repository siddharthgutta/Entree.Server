To round out our array of food venues we decided it was time to hit the road with our chefs, Jason Rogers and Bart Dickerson. The Oskar Blues Bonewagon is our new Barnstormin\u2019 Smokateria on Wheels, a food truck that will be festivalizing wherever it can get its dirty little wheels to\u2013 music venues, festivals, and local parking lots.You\u2019ll be able to find the Bonewagon bellying-up to the Tasty Weasel Taproom\u2019s parking lot on Tuesdays, as well as other days when it\u2019s not showcasing it\u2019s Southern-inspired menu elsewhere.In an ongoing effort to integrate the various components of Oskar Blues, the menu features \u201cRubs\u201d and \u201cTugs,\u201d including an Oskar Blues Hops & Heifers Farm Home Grown Burger, made with beef from our spent-grain-and-grass-fed cows. We\u2019re dishin\u2019 out our Oskar Blues award-winning Smoked Wings, the Morning Chub Breakfast Burrito, and other daily specials in addition to our other menu items.",
