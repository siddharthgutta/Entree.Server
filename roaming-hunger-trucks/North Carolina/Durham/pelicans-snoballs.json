This is North Carolina's tastiest shaved ice, it's fluffy, fresh, and just what your sweet tooth has been wanting. These are the same style of superb SnoBalls you'd find in New Orleans, but with all the lovely convenience of being right down the street from you.Soft snow, dozens of flavors to choose from, and an awesome attitude, Pelican's SnoBalls has it all.",
