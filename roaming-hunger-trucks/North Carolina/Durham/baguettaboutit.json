  "description": "History:From a ski vacation in Switzerland in 1999 to the slopes of the Salt Lake City Olympics in 2002, this sausage-baguette contraption had remained ingrained in the minds (and stomachs) of two Chapel Hill men when one fateful day in 2010 during lunch between friends, this sandwich idea was reborn from memory\u2013and quickly spun into a plan of attack. The Big Blue Baguettaboutit Food Truck has been serving delicious Sausages in the triangle since 2011.  Since August of 2014, Chef Scott Phillips with his culinary background is now the proud owner of Baguettaboutit Food truck to continue serving up these one of a kind quality European style baguettes stuffed with sausages and homemade sauces.  We look to add some new irresistible new scratch made sauces and new sandwiches in 2015!Born from passion, culinary expertise, a dedication to local culture and ingredients* and most of all a really, really great product, we are able to continue on with the BAGUETTABOUTIT quality food in the Triangle!",
