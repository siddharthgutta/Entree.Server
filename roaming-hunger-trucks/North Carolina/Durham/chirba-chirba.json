What does \u201cChirba Chirba\u201d mean?\u201cChirba Chirba\u201d literally means \u201cEat eat!\u201d in Mandarin Chinese when you\u2019re speaking to another person. However the expression embodies a very warm, hospitable feeling when uttered, especially to a friend or guest. In an attempt to communicate the intensity and warmth of \u201cChirba!\u201d, one might translate it as: \u201cThis is so delicious and it makes me extremely happy to see you enjoy it without hesitation, so please, eat!\u201d",
