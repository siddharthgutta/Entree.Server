  "description": "The Ice Queen is a mobile ice cream parlor in Greensboro. Whether you want an old-school Rocket Pop or a snazzy Elvis Ice Cream Sammich, we've got you covered! Not literally covered, but don't worry, we always have plenty of napkins just in case!Snowflake (of course the truck has a name) is always stocked with at least eight flavors of delicious Edy's Grand scoopable ice cream for your creation and a dozen types of Popsicles. Feel free to mix up flavors for a super special milkshake or Sammich. Nothing is too weird. Well, almost nothing. That Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter cup and Mint Chocolate Chip milkshake with rainbow sprinkles...that was a little too much.We go out a lot to make all sorts of folks happy. Big and small, young and old. Ice cream love knows no bounds. Have you ever seen a truck mechanic squeal in delight when the ice cream truck comes by? We have...and it's wonderful. ",
