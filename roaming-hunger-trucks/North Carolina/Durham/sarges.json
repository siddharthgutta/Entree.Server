  "description": "Sarges Chef on Wheels is inspired by and dedicated to my parents. Dad was in the service of our country through the Air Force for 30 years. He served in WWII, Korea, and Vietnam. He retired in 1974 as a First Senior Master Sargent. We thank him and all others who stand up and come to the service of their country. But in particular, Sargents are the back bone of any hierarchy and for that reason we honor sarges everywhere.While my dad's service exposed us to world cultures and cuisine, it was my mother that inspired my love for cooking. My mom had a rare passion for food and used that passion to make people comfortable. She would not simply offer food if you visited our home, she would prepare it and place it in front of you to show that she truly meant for you to enjoy it. Sharing her food with family and friends made her happiest ! Most of our menu items are inspired by our favorite dishes from the many places we lived or were exposed to as a result of military life.",
