  "description": "Sunshine Sammies opened in Asheville, NC in the summer of 2013.  With a hand built solar powered cart full of cold treats, we hit the streets and found that we were not alone in our love for ice cream sandwiches!  Today, you may find us in our hometown with one of our signature carts or our vintage truck, Sunny!  We are spreading the sweet love at farmer's markets, local festivals, private events, and of course at our downtown spot at the corner of Patton Ave and Lexington Ave.  We specialize in all things yummy including ice cream sammies, fresh baked goods, popsicles, and more!  To find the full menu on any given day, stop by the truck. You may just find your next favorite dessert!",
