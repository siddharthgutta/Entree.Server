  "description": "Jamaican Mi Crazy started in 2012 in Washington DC, serving only lunches (Monday - Friday), but demand didn't stay small for long! Family owned and operated, JMC works hard each day to prepare well known, flavorful dishes like Jerk Chicken, Stewed Chicken, Curry Chicken, Curried Goat, Oxtail, Steamed Fish, etc., all served with a side of Rice and Peas or White Rice and Vegetables (such as steamed cabbage with shredded carrots and mixed vegetables) for the entire community. Look out for this truck the next time you are feeling hungry for a taste of \u201cJamaican Mi Crazy\u201d with the seasoned flavor of Jamaican cooking!",
