  "description": "Nadine & Renee grew up in the same town, married two brothers, and after building successful marketing & culinary careers over the course of 10 years, are now swooping Tira (their beloved 1973 VW Van) all over the country, and serving their signature all-natural Scoop & Paddle ice cream. Every town they visit and every event they cater, they can\u2019t help but delight everyone who tries a bite or buys a pint of their delectable handmade creamy creations, made only with the finest ingredients. A few of their lovely concoctions include Key Lime Pie, Cherry Cheesecake, Salted Caramel, and more! You also must try a taste of their famous Ice Cream Sandwiches; Chocolate Chip Cookies with Vanilla Chocolate Cookies with Mint Chip Oatmeal Cookies with Cobbler ice cream, are just a few. For ice cream that\u2019s absolutely wonderful, be sure to seek out Tira and get yourself some Scoop & Paddle. ",
