The robust Beef and Chicken Redang will keep you reordering, and you\u2019ll find yourself craving their perfectly cooked jasmine rice that soothingly cools the heat of the  scrumptiously spicy Balado Shrimp. If you see this distinctive bamboo-lined truck on the street, you'll know you\u2019re in for a deliciously authentic experience!",
