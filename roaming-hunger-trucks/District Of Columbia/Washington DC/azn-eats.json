  "description": "AZNeats is all about Asian (AZN) Food. For many years, Ms. JinJu Lee and her family have resided in the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Area, having immigrated from Seoul, Korea, and she always wanted to start an Asian restaurant. She always thought a city like Washington D.C. that prides itself as the Nation\u2019s Capital, with its diverse fine cuisine, deserved authentic gourmet Korean and other Asian food at a reasonable price. During her recent trip to the West Coast, Ms. Lee found the perfect inspiration (Chef Roy Choi\u2019s \u2013 Kogi BBQ) and platform (mobile gourmet trucks) to showcase her family\u2019s secret recipes. These modern trucks are versatile and will provide the broad Washington D.C. community with access to great Asian food. Hence the idea for \u201cAZNeats\u201d was born.",
