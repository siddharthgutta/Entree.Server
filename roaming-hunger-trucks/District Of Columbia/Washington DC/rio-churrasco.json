  "description": "Rio Churrasco serves up barbecue in Churrasco style, which translates roughly from the Portuguese for 'barbecue'. The barbecue tradition known as churrascaria hails from the southern part of Brazil, from a gaucho technique of cooking meat over an open flame. This method of preparation seals in the meat's natural juices, resulting in a tender, more flavorful steak. Try it today!",
