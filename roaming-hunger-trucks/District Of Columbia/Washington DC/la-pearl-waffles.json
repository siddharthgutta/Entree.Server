  "description": "What is a REAL Belgian Waffle? They originate from a town in Belgium called Liege. Pearl Waffle is a richer, denser, sweeter, and thicker type of waffle. They are cooked from an authentic Belgian brioche dough featuring unique pearl sugar chunks. Within each of these pearls lies the authentic taste which caramelizes on the outside of the waffle when baked. If it needs syrup, it\u2019s not a TRUE authentic Belgian Waffle. Grab one of these delicious treats today!",
