  "description": "OoH DaT ChiCkeN is Washington D.C's first rotisserie chicken food truck. We offer the finest flame broiled rotisserie chicken with fresh local ingredients in the District.  OoH DaT chicken is marinated in our signature blend of spices, herbs, and peppers for 24 hours. The method we use to cook our birds is a low and slow technique which makes the chicken unbelievably juicy and very flavorful. Our blend of secret spices makes OoH DaT Chicken a one of a kind food truck roaming the streets. We hope our concept of using open flame and fresh ingredients will bring a different taste and style to the food truck world in our Nations Capital!",
