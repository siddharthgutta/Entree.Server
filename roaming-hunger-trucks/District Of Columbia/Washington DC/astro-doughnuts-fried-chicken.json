  "description": "Astro is a DC truck serving classic and modern interpretations of two distinctly different, yet equally comforting all-American classics \u2013 fried chicken and doughnuts. Chef Jason Gehring brings an artful and whimsical touch to his doughnuts, while serving up regular, spicy and seasonal varieties of fried chicken. Check out some of the delicious doughnut flavors, including peanut butter and jelly, and dessert-inspired renditions like cr\u00e8me brulee, and don't miss out on the classic buttermilk fried chicken, or the Sriracha blend!",
