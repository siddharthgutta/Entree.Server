  "description": "At The Big Cheese we LOVE cheese in all of its melty glorious gooey deliciousness. And we aren\u2019t just using any cheese\u2026 We use artisan cheeses from Cowgirl Creamery and local farmers markets to make the classic favorite even more yummy. And where would grilled cheese be without its hot little friend tomato soup? Sad and lonely that\u2019s where. So of course we are serving up that trusty sidekick as well.We can\u2019t just put that kind of cheese on just any bread. So Lyon is our bakery. Founded by three like\u2013minded friends in the spring of 2000 who are skilled in the art of gourmet artisan breads. Based out of Southwest, it\u2019s local, it\u2019s delicious enough said.And keeping with artisan theme we serve Route 11 chips. What!?! Artisan chips? Well they are local\u2026 based off I81 just south of I66. Ok not as local as Lyon but not bad for chips. And they run a green operation.",
