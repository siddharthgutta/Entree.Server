  "description": "Doug the Food Dude is a NEW food truck serving the Northern Virginia Metro area. Doug serves Fresh All Natural (No MSG or Preservatives) meals.   Doug has always had a love for cooking. However, about 5 years ago when his daughter developed allergies to MSG and preservatives, Doug had to rethink his cooking and take a new approach.  He thought it was time to share some of his \"favorites\" with you!  What better way than a restaurant on wheels.    Some of his signature dishes are, Caribbean Roasted Pork drizzled with a mango garlic sauce over The Dude's Cabana Rice, Crispy Baked Fajita Egg Rolls, and Parmesan crusted Salmon over Cabana Rice.  With the arrival of warm weather The Dude now carries All Natural, Gluten Free, Hershey's Ice Cream.   Please consider us for your next event.  We cater for all events large and small!",
