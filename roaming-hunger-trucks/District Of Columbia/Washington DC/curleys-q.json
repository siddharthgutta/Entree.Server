  "description": "2014 Best BBQ Food Truck in the DMV (Meat week, peoples choice)  Serving authentic BBQ and some interesting surprises! Curley's was born from my passion of cooking and sharing that passion with fiends and family. For years almost everyone I know wanted me to start a restaurant and for years I said that I don't want to be a slave to my passion. So the stars and the moon aligned and the next thing you know I am cruising the county in a yellow truck serving BBQ.I hope that you have the time to come by and taste my creations! I am a believer that good Q should stand on its own, meaning that the meats should taste good from the start and if you want to kick it up a notch there are my crafted sauces to make it exactly the way YOU like it, not how the Texans or the Carolinas like it!Come by and taste what real hardwood smoked BBQ taste like that has been slow cooked for 10 to 18 hours!I cant wait to MEAT you!Curley",
