  "description": "Mama's Donut Bites is a mobile food truck in Washington, DC that specializes in delicious, hot mini-donuts made fresh right before your eyes!  We experiment making various flavors of donut bites using local ingredients. You get to watch the entire process from scratch: the donut batter is made on-site, then our Donut Robot drops, flips and dispenses these mini bites of heaven. At the toppings bar, you have a wide variety of toppings to choose from.  Throughout the year, we feature seasonal donuts with local, seasonal ingredients.",
