  "description": "the frosted muffin is a cupcake truck based in Prince William County in Northern Virginia.  What sets us apart are our \"square\" cupcakes. Once you lick the frosting off of a cupcake, it becomes a muffin. Muffins are healthy! So don't feel guilty if you can't stop yourself from eating more than just one. ;)",
