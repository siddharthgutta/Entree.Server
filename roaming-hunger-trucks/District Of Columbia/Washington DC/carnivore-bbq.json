We locally source our provisions and prepare from scratch our own slaws, sauces, and rubs. The pit master roasts our meats slowly over real hard-wood. In fact, it takes 22 hours to smoke both our brisket and pulled pork.Moreover, we offer a relaxed friendly atmosphere because while life may be short, it should be sweet whenever possible. Eat in good health from all of us at Carnivore BBQ.Stephen AdelsonPit Master",
