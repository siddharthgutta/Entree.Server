  "description": "The Crab Cab is a 5 Star mobile \"restaurant\" on wheels that is nevertheless affordable! This truck uses the freshest ingredients to create delectable soups, and sumptuous \"finger-licking\" crab cakes. But the menu doesn't stop there! It also includes succulent hickory-smoked salmon that literally melts in your mouth. Hungry for a bite? Just make sure when you see the signature yellow and black checkerboard logo with Mr. Crabby on it with his shades on that you hail it to stop like a New York City Cab. You will be glad that you did.
