  "description": "You can enjoy Virginia\u2019s favorite taste of the Steel City at your next exciting event, all thanks to the Pittsburgh Rick\u2019s truck. This acclaimed eatery set up shop in 2014, and when they first introduced the local foodies to their selection of authentic Pittsburgh-style sandwiches (loaded up with french fries, crisp apple cider slaw, and fresh sliced tomatoes), it became clear that these mouthwatering meals should definitely be made mobile. Whether you\u2019re hitting up this truck for your Pittsburgh Rick\u2019s fix after a great show at Jiffy Lube Live, or you invite it to come cater your next party, you\u2019re sure to savor every bite of their best sellers, like the Pastrami & Cheese or Burgher & Cheese, as well as their fresh hot hand-cut fries, or yummy chocolatey ooey gooey brownies, and so much more.
