  "description": "CHOUPI was founded by two founders who believed in the future of bistro-quality crepes in a reasonable price. One of them had worked as a pastry chef in various well-known restaurants in Paris, France and Washington, DC over ten years. The other founder had a passion for foods and was fully convinced of the business opportunity in CHOUPI and converted herself into a full supporter of the business from an engineer.Together, they created the amazing cart you can find on the DC streets today. Whether you're in the mood for a breakfast, savory, or dessert crepe or waffle, CHOUPI is the place to be! Stop by and find out for yourself!",
