  "description": "Chubby Wieners Wiener Wagon, is an extension of our store front. This is where our meats hit the streets.In 2005, The Fourkas brothers decided to get into the kitchen, and redefine what \"Chicago Style\" is all about.  A culture known and joined from coast to coast. The Fourkas brothers took to the biggest, juiciest Wieners anyone had ever seen. So obviously, there was only one name for them CHUBBY WIENERS.As time passes, and other places are just discovering taste, and size that matters, the boys look to make, prepare and sell the freshest Wieners the way intended. Fresh all beef, never frozen. Cooked-to-order, just the way you want it, every time.",
