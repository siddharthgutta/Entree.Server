  "description": "D\u00f6nerMen is anthropology through food. Try Currywurst, a post-war Berlin invention combining Indian spices via British Imperialism and German sausage in one dish. Or try the other D\u00f6nerMen stalwart, D\u00f6ner Kebab, a marriage of flavors brought to Germany by Turkish immigrants in the early 1970's, packaged for the fast pace of modern Berlin.Sound highfalutin? It\u2019s not. You know how the U.S has tex-mex? This is sorta of a Ger-Turk. Or is it Turk-Ger? Either way it's delicious.Stop by and try some of this fantastic fusion street food today!To read about how this truck is turning hearts and minds to the fusion way, check out the Roaming Hunger blog here: http://roaminghunger.com/blog/8530/donermen-serve-the-largest-open-air-christmas-festival",
