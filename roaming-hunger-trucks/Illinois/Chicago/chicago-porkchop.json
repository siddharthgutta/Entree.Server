  "description": "Chicago Porkchop is roaming the streets and - the name basically says it all - serving meats, greens, drinks, and desserts.What is PORKCHOP? It\u2019s the lack of pretense and preening. It\u2019s being uninterested in dress codes, zip codes and trend-chasing. It\u2019s about being comfortable in the corner without paying out the pocket. It\u2019s about having a great night with dear friends or meeting some new ones.",
