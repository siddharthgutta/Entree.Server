  "description": "Jack's Fork In The Road is a truck on a mission, run by a man on a mission! Chef Jack's 20+ years of experience in food service led him to believe that food trucks have the same potential for greatness that brick&mortar; restaurants have, and he strives to illustrate this greatness in his fantastic gourmet sandwiches. His Grilled 3 Cheese sandwich and sweet potato fries are a must-try!",
