  "description": "City: Champaign-Urbana, ILNo one loves a great breakfast as much as a college student who has been up all night... studying. So much to the delight of University of Illinois students, the Cracked truck has come to grace the campus curbside doling out delicious breakfast sandwiches, and hot brewed coffee! Cracked uses locally baked breads and locally sourced meats to give their customers the highest quality ingredients in town. ",
