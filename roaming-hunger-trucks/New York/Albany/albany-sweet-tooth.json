  "description": "Albany Sweet Tooth was founded in November 2012 in Schenectady, NY, when we started serving sweet treats online. In 2014 we graduated to selling our homemade baked yummies for private celebrations, birthday parties, anniversaries, and policy meetings. We climbed the ladder in 2014 to serving the public at Cultural Events which included Family Day at the Egg Plaza, Kids Day and a host of other events. Our latest venture is our dessert truck! ",
