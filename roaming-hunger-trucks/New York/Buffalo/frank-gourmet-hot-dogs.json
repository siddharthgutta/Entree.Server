  "description": "Frank Gourmet Hot Dogs is a mobile food truck in Buffalo that puts a gourmet twist on an American classic \u2013 the hot dog. That's right folks, no dirty water dogs here! Instead, we take the hot dog and do our best to make it better. Using fresh ingredients and a little creative genius, Frank approaches the hot dog in a way that no other casual restaurant or food cart in Buffalo has ever done!  In addition to hot dogs, Frank offers hand-cut fries accompanied with specialty ketchups and aiolis. Our sweet potato fries are kicked up with garlic, cilantro and lime. We also offer a variety of vegetarian options, including homemade veggie dogs. ",
