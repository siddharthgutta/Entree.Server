  "description": "Everyone in Oceanside is hopelessly devoted to the pizza from Pronto\u2019s Brick Oven. Once you try a taste of this traditional Napoli-style pizza, with the crust so crispy and flavorful, and toppings so fresh and delicious, you and your taste buds surely will be too. This big blazing truck is run by a first generation Italian family, so they know what they\u2019re doing when they\u2019re whipping up high-quality pizzas with delightful toppings like fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, eggplant, prosciutto, and more. Their wood-fired oven is burning so hot, your pie will be perfect and ready in no time. You will also find delectable Garlic Bread, and hot & saucy Meatball or Eggplant Parm Heroes. Oh, and you just can\u2019t pass up their scrumptiously crunchy and creamy Cannoli or their oh-so-excellent Espresso. Make your way on over to Pronto (pronto!) and treat yourself to an extraordinary pizza experience. ",
