  "description": "Wooly's serves a low-calorie frozen dessert known as \"Shaved Snow\". Shaved Snow is a block of ice made with low fat milk which is then shaved down very fine to create a texture similar to fresh fallen snow. Topped with fruits and delicious toppings, it is then completed with drizzles such as our \"Sea Salt Leche\" finish to create a deliciously light and unique frozen dessert. Wooly's won the Vendy Awards for Best Dessert in NYC. We look forward to making it snow at your next event or party!",
