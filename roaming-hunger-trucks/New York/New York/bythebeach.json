  "description": "The beach buddies of Rockaway, NY prefer to live by the beach rather than by the book. That\u2019s probably why they\u2019re going nuts over the refreshing Thai young coconuts that ByTheBeach is shelling out. Childhood friends Mikey, Dylan, and Ryan have always had a dream to bring the blissful vibes of the beach to the urban streets of this vibrant NY town, and they found the perfect way: providing the Rockaway Kreative Natives with refreshing, healthy, delicious, and beachy coconut water - straight out of a fresh cold coconut shipped directly from Thailand. And wouldn\u2019t you know, these cocos are a huge hit! Take some advice from the New York Post; add this truck to your summer bucket list. This is a beach party that can\u2019t be missed!",
