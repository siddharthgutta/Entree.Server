  "description": "Carpe Donut NYC is making hot, fresh, hand made donuts on the streets of the big city. You have never eaten a donut like this. Only the finest ingredients are used, including organic flour and spices, as well as local eggs and apple.Cool off this summer with the FroDo\u2014a donut ice cream sandwich, hand packed with organic vanilla Blue Marble ice cream. All donuts are cooked in 100% pure soybean oil - no hydrogenation, no trans-fats, no shortening. These donuts are all natural so if you are not going to eat them within a couple hours, you should refrigerate or freeze them. These babies are fresh and don\u2019t have an indefinite \u201cshelf life\u201d like those other things that are passed off as donuts.In addition to the donuts, organic coffee, cioccollata (Italian style hot chocolate), and fresh mulled hot cider are also served.",
