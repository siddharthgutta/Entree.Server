  "description": "Snowy's is showing NYC just how amazingly delicious shaved ice can be.  This super cute truck is brought to you by two former Wall Street ladies who, after a while of conquering the financial scene, were ready to shake things up by bringing tasty traditional Asian shaved ice to the streets. Now the whole east coast is loving their bright and beautiful, gluten free and vegan creations; like the tremendously refreshing Tropic Thunder: Pi\u00f1a Colada Shaved Ice, Pineapple Coconut Ice, Coconut Cream, Pineapple Nata De Coco, and Toasted Coconut. There is just so much more to adore, so you must come out and try some Snowy\u2019s, for sure. ",
