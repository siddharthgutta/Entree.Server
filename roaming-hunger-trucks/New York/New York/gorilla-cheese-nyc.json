  "description": "Gorilla Cheese NYC is leading the NYC food truck revolution, taking comfort food and home cooking to a new level.  We use only use fresh baked bread delivered from our local bakeries, and a wide variety of delicious cheeses. But what makes our sandwiches extra special is that they're always made with lots of love.  Relive the after-school grilled cheese your mom used to make with our \"GCNYC1 CLASSIC\" (American on buttery white bread).  Push the culinary envelope and try our \"BROOKLYN SPECIAL\" (Fresh Asiago w/Prosciutto de Parma on inside out Panini w/ aioli).  And don't forget our tasty sides such as our crispy Tater Tots, Killer Mac & Cheese, Cup of Tomato Soup & Mac & Cheese Bites.  No meal is complete w/o the \"Big S\" smores desert on homemade graham cracker bread, it's YUM. Track our progress, find our truck and join us for a meal on a street near you. It's Easy Being Cheesy.",
