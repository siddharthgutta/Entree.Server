  "description": "Reina Bermudez and Rafael Soler, husband and wife, began building their legendary food truck from the ground up about 11 years ago, starting off with just an old van, a couple tables, a grill, and a coffee pot, selling their now-famous pupusas outside the Red Hook Ball Fields. Their pupusas are positively stuffed to perfection, with fillings that include chicken, fish, chicharron, spinach, queso,  just to name a few. As they grew more confident and experienced in their culinary endeavors, it didn\u2019t take long for word of their delicious Salvadoran cuisine to spread throughout all of Brooklyn. With their friendly service and wonderful food, Solber Pupusas has even been featured in multiple articles and Food Network segments. So if any local foodie is ever lookin\u2019 for tasty pupusas, tamales, and more, they know exactly where to go.",
