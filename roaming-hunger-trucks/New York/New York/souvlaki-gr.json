  "description": "Often lovingly referred to as \"the hamburger of Greece\", souvlaki is a staple of the Greek diet with roots dating back to Ancient Greece. In this era of omnipresent corporate fast food chains, the souvlaki has remained a constant. The power and the taste of this delicious yet inexpensive little meal has triumphed over thousands of years. As the most popular fast food item in the country, souvlaki is sold on nearly every corner of every street, however,finding an authentic souvlaki is nearly impossible here in the States. Since the term \"souvlaki\" is perpetually misused, people often tend to think of it as an unappetizing version of \"street meat\". We are determined to defy that notion! What we have for you is the authentic Greek souvlaki. A traditional combination of charcoal grilled meat, a warm pita and our homemade sauce - just simple, fresh ingredients. ",
