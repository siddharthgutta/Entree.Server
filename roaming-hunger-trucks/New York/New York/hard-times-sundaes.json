  "description": "Rated the #1 burger truck in NYC, Hard Time Sundaes is serving up delicious, juicy burgers that make the local foodies (including the top chefs of NY) just go bonkers. After Andrew Zurica\u2019s restaurant (The Luncheonette, in Mill Basin, Brooklyn) was tragically destroyed by Hurricane Sandy, the acclaimed chef decided to get a truck and keep serving his beloved American cuisine out on the streets. His signature \u201cHard Times Burger\u201d (a single, double, or triple prime Angus burger with American cheese, slowly caramelized onions, and thick cut hardwood smoked bacon, all on a buttered and grilled potato roll) became so rapidly famous due to its divine tastiness, that Zurica\u2019s food soon caught the attention of the press, and the rest is history. Now everyone knows exactly where to go when they\u2019re craving the perfect burger with the freshest and highest quality ingredients. And of course, you can\u2019t forget to order up Hard Times\u2019 classic & creamy frozen treats, Brooklyn-style hot dogs, soups, fries, and much more. For a quintessential modern New York experience, complete with an utterly mouthwatering all-American meal, make your way straight to the Hard Time Sundaes truck. ",
