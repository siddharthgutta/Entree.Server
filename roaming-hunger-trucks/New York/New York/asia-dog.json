  "description": "Asiadogs are hot dogs with Asian-inspired toppings. Born from a love of NYC, we wanted to push the limits of one of its most popular street foods by adding our own personal touch with super-fresh ingredients.Coming from mixed Asian backgrounds, we celebrate NYC's diversity by incorporating flavors found in China, Korea, Vietnam, Japan, and more.We started in 2008 in the backyard of a friends bar with the basic principles of GOOD FOOD, GOOD FRIENDS, and GOOD FUN, and as we've grown to locations including the Brooklyn Flea, Central Park Summerstage, and our very first brick and mortar, we strive everyday to hold true to these fundamentals. So come check out one of our seven unique dogs... or our signature burger. We hope to see you soon!",
