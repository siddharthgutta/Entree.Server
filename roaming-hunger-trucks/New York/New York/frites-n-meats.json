  "description": "We know what it means to bite into a juicy, perfectly cooked Burger. We know you know it too. It's heaven! What we didn't know or understand was why it was so hard to get it. Not why it was hard to get a fancy pants Burger for $15+. That you can get anywhere. But why was it so hard to get that same fancy pants Burger at half that price or less. We looked, we looked and we looked some more, but it just wasn't there. So we decided to do it ourselves.We knew the key was coming up with the best core ingredients - meat, buns & cheese, and to develop a range of premium toppings that would transform the core ingredients into something extraordinary. In New York City when you're looking for the best meat, bread and cheese, inevitably your path will lead you to DeBragga & Spitler, Balthazar Bakery, & Murray's Cheese. Once we had that, the rest came easy. We decided to have our toppings be the things we really liked on our Burgers. When you buy a Burger from us, when we wrap that Burger for you and put it in the bag, that Burger is medium-rare. If you were to eat that Burger as soon as we hand it to you, you would find it to be cooked to a perfect medium-rare. However most food bought on the street is not eaten on the spot. It's usually taken to the office or home. It usually takes most people 10 - 15 minutes to go from buying the food to eating it back home or in their office. During that time, due to the heat insulating wrapping we use, the Burger actually continues to cook. It is this time lag, that results in the Burger being cooked to medium-well or even well done. The same principle that applies to food bought at a restaurant, food delivered, or food cooked yourself - You have to eat food when it's prepared for it to be at it's best. ",
