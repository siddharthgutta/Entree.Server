  "description": "Chef Einat Admony and Stefan Nafziger, the husband and wife team behind one of New York\u2019s most favorite & famous falafel and smoothie stops, Ta\u00efm, has taken their acclaimed and authentic Middle Eastern menu out to the streets, and the local foodies could not be more pleased. The moment this big, beautiful truck first appeared on the curbs, it immediately began to sweep up awards, like \u201cBest Truck\u201d- New York Magazine, \u201cBest Vegetarian Street Foods\u201d- The Village Voice, and many more. Of course, it\u2019s no wonder with its delectable selection of sandwiches, platters, and salads with homemade falafel, hummus, and more, all made with the freshest ingredients. In addition, their craveable and refreshing smoothies (like the date-lime-banana) and beverages (like the ginger-mint-lemonade) also always wow the crowds. For an incredibly delicious meal on the streets of New York, be sure to add a visit to The Ta\u00efm Mobile to your itinerary. ",
