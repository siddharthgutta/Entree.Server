While growing up in the culinary mecca of Queens, his family gatherings always featured good food with bold flavors influenced by Guyana, the American South and China in the spotlight.  His family\u2019s delicious, down home food played a huge part in Big D\u2019s childhood and then ultimately shaped his love of food which became a desire to learn how to cook.  His dream is to share his passion for food with everyone and now it\u2019s a reality with Big D\u2019s Grub Truck.  This brainchild of Big D\u2019s desire to share honest, good tasting food with a focus on big flavors and big tastes is now hitting the streets of Manhattan.  Big D is proud to bring his big flavored cooking to the people of New York!",
