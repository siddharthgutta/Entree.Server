  "description": "With a desire to slurp on one of those good ole refreshing convenience store-style slushies without the overwhelming sugar content and suspect fluorescent colors, Alex and Zack left their corporate law careers behind and whipped up a plan to serve New Yorkers some quality, all-natural slush. Now the Kelvin Slush Co. truck is skating through the streets, delighting children and adults alike with their wonderful flavors; Ginger, Citrus, and Tea, all organic, gluten-free, vegan, non-GMO, kosher, and sweetened with raw evaporated cane sugar and organic agave, so you can slurp away as you please, totally guilt-free. And it gets even cooler, Kelvin Slush also offers wonderfully fresh fruit mix-ins\u2019, like mint, basil, white peach, raspberry, guava, and more. For a Vendy-award winning food truck experience, you simply must quench your thirst at Kelvin Slush!",
